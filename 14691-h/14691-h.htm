   <p>The behavior of a great Hope is like the setting of the sun. It
  splashes out from under a horizontal cloud, so diabolically
  incandescent that you see a dozen false suns blotting the heavens
  with purple in every direction. You bury your eyes in a handkerchief,
  with your back carefully turned upon the west, and meantime the
  spectacle you were waiting for takes place and disappears. You
  promise yourself to nick it better to-morrow. The soul withdraws into
  its depths. The stars arise (offering two or three thousand more
  impracticable suns), and the night is ironical.</p>

  <p>Having already conquered, without boasting, a certain success
  before the reading public, and having persuaded an author of renown
  to sign his name to my bantling, my Expectation and Hope have long
  been to surpass that trifling production. You may think it a slight
  thing to prepare a lucky volume, and, tapping Fame familiarly on the
  shoulder, engage her to undertake its colportage throughout the
  different countries of the globe. My first little work of travel and
  geography had exceeded my dreams of a good reception. It had earned
  me several <span class="pagenum">[pg 10]</span> proposals from
  publishers; it had been annotated with &quot;How true!&quot; and
  &quot;Most profound!&quot; by the readers in public libraries; its
  title had given an imaginative air to the ledgers of book-sellers;
  and it had added a new shade of moodiness to the collection of Mudie.
  The man who hits one success by accident is always trying to hit
  another by preparation. Since that achievement I have thought of
  nothing but the creation of another impromptu, and I have really
  prepared a quantity of increments toward it in the various places to
  which my traveling existence has led me. That I have settled down,
  since these many years past, at the centre and capital of ideas would
  prove me, even without the indiscretions of that first little book,
  an American by birth. I need not add that my card is printed in
  German text, Paul Fleming, and that time has brought to me a not
  ungraceful, though a sometimes practically retardating,
  circumference. Beneath a mask of cheerfulness, and even of obesity,
  however, I continue to guard the sensitive feelings of my earlier
  days. Yes: under this abnormal convexity are fostered, as behind a
  lens, the glowing tendencies of my youth. Though no longer, like the
  Harold described in Icelandic verse by Regner Hairy-Breeches, &quot;a
  young chief proud of my flowing locks,&quot; yet I still &quot;spend
  my mornings among the young maidens,&quot; or such of them as
  frequent the American Colony, as we call it, in Paris. I still
  &quot;love to converse with the handsome widows.&quot; Miss
  Ashburton, who in one little passage of our youth treated me with
  considerable disrespect, and who afterward married a person of great
  lingual accomplishments, her father&#39;s late courier, at Naples,
  has been handsomely forgiven, but not forgotten. A few intelligent
  ladies, of marked listening powers and conspicuous accomplishments,
  are habitually met by me at their residences in the neighborhood of
  the Arc de Triomphe or at the receptions of the United States
  minister. These fair attractions, although occupying, in practice, a
  preponderating share of my time, are as nothing to me, however, in
  comparison with that enticing illusion, my Book.</p>

  <p>The scientific use of the imagination in treating the places and
  distances of <span class="pagenum">[pg 11]</span> Geography is the
  dream of my days and the insomnia of my nights.</p>

  <p>Every morning I take down and dust the loose sheets of my coming
  book or polish the gilding of my former one. It is in my fidelity to
  these baffling hopes&#8212;hopes fed with so many withered (or at
  least torn and blotted) leaves&#8212;rather than in any resemblance
  authenticable by a looking-glass, that I show my identity with the
  old long-haired and nasal Flemming.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;">

  <p>Yet, though so long a Parisian, and so comfortable in my theoretic
  pursuit of Progressive Geography, my leisure hours are unconsciously
  given to knitting myself again to past associations, and some of my
  deepest pleasures come from tearing open the ancient wounds. Shall
  memory ever lose that sacred, that provoking day in the Vale of
  Lauterbrunnen when the young mechanic in green serenaded us with his
  guitar? It had for me that quite peculiar and personal application
  that it immediately preceded my rejection by Miss Mary. The Staubbach
  poured before our eyes, as from a hopper in the clouds, its Stream of
  Dust. The Ashburtons, clad in the sensible and becoming fashion of
  English lady-tourists, with long ringlets and Leghorn hats, sat on
  either side of me upon the grass. And then that implacable youth,
  looking full in my eye, sang his verses of insulting sagacity:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">She gives thee a garland woven fair;</p>

      <p class="i8">Take care!</p>

      <p class="i2">It is a fool&#39;s-cap for thee to wear;</p>

      <p class="i8">Beware! beware!</p>

      <p class="i8">Trust her not,</p>

      <p class="i4">She is fooling thee!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Meeting him two or three times afterward as he pursued his
  apprentice-tour, I felt as though I had encountered a green-worm. And
  I confess that it was partly on his account that I made a vow,
  fervently uttered and solemnly kept, never again to visit Switzerland
  or the Rhine. Miss Ashburton I easily forgave. The disadvantage, I
  distinctly felt, was hers, solely and restrictedly hers; and I should
  have treated with profound respect, if I had come across him, the
  professional traveler who was good enough to marry her afterward.</p>

  <p>But these bitter-sweet recollections are only the relief to my
  studies. It is true they are importunate, but they are strictly kept
  below stairs.</p>

  <p>Nor would any one, regarding the stout and comfortable Flemming,
  suspect what regrets and what philosophies were disputing possession
  of his interior. For my external arrangements, I flatter myself that
  I have shaped <i>them</i> in tolerable taste.</p>

  <p>My choice of the French capital I need not defend to any of my
  American readers. To all of you this consummation is simply a matter
  of ability. I heartily despise, as I always did, all mere pamperings
  of physical convenience. Still, for some who retain some <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 12]</span> sympathy with the Paul Flemming of
  aforetime, it may be worth while to mention the particular physical
  conveniencies my soul contemns. I inhabit, and have done so for eight
  years at least, a neat little residence of the kind styled
  &quot;between court and garden,&quot; and lying on the utmost
  permissible circumference of the American quarter in Paris&#8212;say
  on the hither side of Passy. For nearly the same period I have had in
  lease a comical box at Marly, whither I repair every summer. My
  town-quarters, having been furnished by an artist, gave me small
  pains. The whole interior is like a suite of rooms in the Hôtel
  Cluny. The only trouble was in bringing up the cellar to the quality
  I desired and in selecting domestics&#8212;points on which, though
  careless of worldly comfort in general, I own I am somewhat
  particular.</p>

  <p>No gentleman valets for me&#8212;rude creatures presuming to
  outdress their masters. What I wanted was the Corporal Trim style of
  thing&#8212;bald, faithful, ancient retainer. After a world of
  vexation I succeeded in finding an artless couple, who agreed for a
  stipulation to sigh when I spoke of my grandfather before my guests,
  and to have been brought up in the family.</p>

  <p>But I am wandering, and neglecting the true vein of sentiment
  which so abounds in my heart. All my pleasure is still in mournful
  contemplation, but I have learned that the feelings are most
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 13]</span> refined when freed from low
  cares and personal discomforts. I was going to cite a letter I wrote
  to my oldest friend, the baron of Hohenfels. It was sketched out
  first in verse, but in that form was a failure:</p>
  <hr />

  <p class="author">&quot;15th MARCH.</p>

  <p>&quot;The snow-white clouds beyond my window are piled up like
  Alps. The shades of B. Franklin and W. Tell seem to walk together on
  those Elysian Fields; for it was here (or sufficiently nigh for the
  purpose) that in days gone by our pure patriot dwelt and flirted with
  Madame Helvetius; and yonder clouds so much resemble the snowy Alps
  that they remind me irresistibly of the Swiss. Noble examples of a
  high purpose and a fixed will! Do B. and W. not move, Hyperion-like,
  on high? Were <i>they</i> not, likewise, sons of Heaven and
  Earth?</p>

  <p>&quot;I wish I knew the man who called flowers &#39;the fugitive
  poetry of Nature.&#39; That was a sweet carol, which I think I have
  quoted to you, sung by the Rhodian children of old in spring, bearing
  in their hands a swallow, and chanting &#39;The swallow is come,&#39;
  with some other lines, which I have forgotten. A pretty carol is
  that, too, which the Hungarian boys, on the islands of the Danube,
  sing to the returning stork in spring, what time it builds its nests
  in the chimneys and gracefully diverts the draft of smoke into the
  interior. What a thrill of delight in spring-time! What a joy in
  being and moving! Some housekeepers might object to that, and say
  that there was but imperfect joy in moving; but I am about to propose
  to you, as soon as I have taken a little more string, a plan of
  removal that will suit both us and the season. My friend, the time of
  storms is flying before the pretty child called April, who pursues it
  with his blooming thyrsus. Breathing scent upon the air, he has
  already awakened some of the trees on the boulevards, and the white
  locust-blossoms in the garden of Rossini are beginning to hang out
  their bunches to attract the nightingales. He calls to the swallows,
  and they arrive in clouds.</p>

  <p>&quot;He knocks at the hard envelope of the chrysalis, which
  accordingly prepares to take its chance for a precarious
  metamorphosis&#8212;into the wings of the butterfly or into the bosom
  of the bird. How very sweet!</p>

  <p>&quot;Strange is the lesson, my friend, which humanity teaches
  itself from the larva. Even so do I, methinks, feed in life&#39;s
  autumn upon the fading foliage of Hope, and, still feeding and
  weaving, turn it at last into a little grave. A neat image that,
  which, by the by, I stole from Drummond of Hawthornden. Do you
  recollect his verse?&#8212;but of course I should be provoked if I
  thought you did&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">For, with strange thoughts possessed,</p>

      <p class="i6">I feed on fading leaves</p>

      <p class="i6">Of hope&#8212;which me deceives,</p>

  <p>&quot;To pursue my subject: April, having thus balanced the
  affairs of the bird and the worm, proceeds to lay over the meadows a
  tablecloth for the bees. He <span class="pagenum">[pg 14]</span>
  opens all the windows of Paris, and on the streets shows us the sap
  mounting in carnation in the faces of the girls.</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear Hohenfels, I invite you to the festival which Spring
  is spreading just now in the village of Marly. My cabin will be
  gratified to open in your honor. May it keep you until autumn! Come,
  and come at once.&quot;</p>

  <p>Having signed my missive, I tucked it into an envelope, which I
  blazoned with my favorite seal, the lyre of Hyperion broken, and rang
  for Charles. In his stead, in lieu of my faithful Charles, it was
  Hohenfels himself who entered, fresh from the Hôtel Mirabeau.</p>

  <p>&quot;Look alive, man! Can you lend me an umbrella?&quot; said he
  briskly.</p>

  <p>I looked out at the window: it was snowing.</p>

  <p>The moment seemed inopportune for the delivery of my epistle: I
  endeavored to conceal it&#8212;without hypocrisy and by a natural
  movement&#8212;under the usual pile of manuscript on my table devoted
  to Progressive Geography. But the baron had spied his name on the
  address: &quot;How is that? You were writing to me? There, I will
  spare you the trouble of posting.&quot;</p>

  <p>He read my sentences, turning at the end of each period to look
  out at the snow, which was heavily settling in large damp flakes. He
  said nothing at first about the discrepancy, but only looked forth
  alternately with his reading, which was pointed enough. I said long
  ago that the beauty of Hohenfels&#39; character, like that of the
  precious opal, was owing to a defect in his organization. The baron
  retains his girlish expression, his blue eye, and his light hair of
  the kind that never turns gray: he is still slender, but much bent.
  He went over to the fireplace and crouched before the coals that were
  flickering there still. Then he said, with that gentle, half-laughing
  voice, &quot;Take care, Paul, old boy! Children who show sense too
  early never grow, they say: by parity of argument, men who are
  poetical too late in life never get their senses.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I have given up poetry,&quot; said I, &quot;and you cannot
  scan that communication in your hand.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But it is something worse than poetry! It is prose inflated
  and puffed and bubbled. You are falling into your old moony ways
  again, and sonneteering in plain English. Are you not ashamed, at
  your age?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What age do you mean? I feel no infirmities of age. If my
  hair is gray, &#39;tis not with years, as By&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If your hair is gray, it is because you are forty-eight, my
  old beauty.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Forty-five!&quot; I said, with some little natural heat.</p>

  <p>&quot;Forty-five let it be, though you have said so these three
  years. And what age is that to go running after the foot of the
  rainbow? Here you are, my dear Flemming, breathing forth hymns to
  Spring, and inviting your friends to picnics! Don&#39;t you know that
  April is the traitor among the twelve months of the year? You are
  ready to strike for Marly in a linen coat and slippers! Have you
  forgotten, my poor fellow, that Marly is windy and raw, and that
  Louis XIV. caught that chill at Marly of which he died? Ah, Paul, you
  are right enough. You are young, still young. You are not
  forty-eight: you are sixteen&#8212;sixteen for the third
  time.&quot;</p>

  <p>Hohenfels, whose once fine temper is going a little, stirred the
  fire and suddenly rose.</p>

  <p>&quot;Lend me an umbrella!&quot; he repeated
  imperatively.</p>

   <span class="pagenum">[pg 15]</span>

  <p>&quot;Are you in such a hurry to go? That is not very
  complimentary to me,&quot; I observed. &quot;Have you done scolding
  me?&quot;</p>

  <p>What is called by some my growing worldliness teaches me to value
  dryness in an old friend as I value dryness in a fine, cobwebbed,
  crusty wine. It is from the merest Sybaritism that I surround myself
  with comrades who, like Hohenfels, can fit their knobs into my
  pattern, and receive my knobs in their own vacancy. My hint brought
  him over at once into the leathern chair opposite the one I
  occupy.</p>

  <p>&quot;Paul, Paul,&quot; he said, &quot;I only criticise you for
  your good. What have you done with your three adolescences? You are
  getting stout, yet you still write poetically. You have some wit,
  imagination, learning and aptitude. You might make a name in science
  or art, but everything you do lacks substance, because you live only
  in your old eternal catchwords of the Past and the Future. You can
  sketch and paint, yet have never exhibited your pictures except in
  ladies&#39; albums. You profess to love botany, yet your sole
  herbarium has been the mignonette in sewing-girls&#39; windows. You
  are inoffensive, you are possessed of a competency, but in
  everything, in every vocation, you rest in the state of
  amateur&#8212;amateur housekeeper, amateur artist, amateur traveler,
  amateur geographer. And such a geographer as you might be, with your
  taste for travel and the Hakluyt Society&#39;s publications you have
  pored over for years!&quot;</p>

  <p>This chance allusion to my grand secret took me from my guard.
  Hohenfels, blundering up and down in search of something to
  anathematize, had stumbled upon the very fortress of my strength. I
  deemed it time to let him into a part of my reserved intellectual
  treasure&#8212;to whirl away a part at least of the sand in which my
  patient sphinx had been buried.</p>

  <p>&quot;I have indeed been a reader,&quot; I said modestly.
  &quot;When a youth at Heidelberg, I perused, with more profit than
  would be immediately guessed from the titles, such works as the
  Helden-Buchs and the Nibelungen-Lieds, the Saxon Rhyme-Chronicles,
  the poems of Minnesingers and Mastersingers, and Ships of Fools, and
  Reynard Foxes, and Death-Dances, and Lamentations of Damned Souls. My
  study since then has been in German chemistry from its renaissance in
  Paracelsus, and physical science, including both medicine and the
  evolution of life. Shall I give you a few dozen of my favorite
  writers?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Quite unnecessary,&quot; said the baron with some haste.
  &quot;But I fancied you were going to speak of geographical
  authors.&quot;</p>

  <a href="images/0012.jpg"><img width="150" align=
  "left" hspace="16" border="0" src="images/0012.jpg" alt="image 12" /></a>
  <!--IMAGE END-->
   <span class="pagenum">[pg 16]</span>

  <p>&quot;Are you fond of such writings yourself?&quot; I asked.</p>

  <p>&quot;Immensely&#8212;that is, not too scientific, you know,&quot;
  said the baron, who was out of his element here. &quot;Bayard Taylor,
  now, or some such fellows as the Alpine Club.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear baron, the republications by the Hakluyt Society are
  but a small part of the references I have taken down for my
  Progressive Geography. You admire Switzerland?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Vastly. Steep jump, the Staubbach.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But the Alps are only hillocks compared with the Andes of
  Peru, with the Cordilleras, with Chimborazo! Ah, baron, Chimborazo!
  Well, my dear boy, the system I elaborate makes it a matter of simple
  progression and calculation to arrive at mountains much more
  considerable still.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Such as&#8212;?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The Mountains of the Moon!&quot;</p>

  <p>I then, in a few dexterously involved sentences, allowed the plan
  of my newly-invented theory to appear&#8212;so much of it, that is,
  as would leave Hohenfels completely in the dark, and detract in no
  wise from the splendor of my Opus when it should be published. As
  science, however, truly considered, is the art of dilapidating and
  merging into confused ruin the theories of your predecessors, I was
  somewhat more precise with the destructive than the constructive part
  of my plan.</p>

  <p>&quot;Geographical Science, I am prepared to show, is that which
  modern learning alone has neglected, to the point of leaving its
  discoveries stationary. It is not so with the more assiduously
  cultivated branches. What change, what advance, in every other
  department of culture! In geology, the ammonite of to-day was for
  Chalmers a parody facetiously made by Nature in imitation of her
  living conchology, and for Voltaire a pilgrim&#39;s cockle dropped in
  the passes of the Alps. In medicine, what progress has been made
  since ague was compared to the flutter of insects among the nerves,
  and good Mistress Dorothy Burton, who died but in 1629, cured it by
  hanging a spider round the patient&#39;s neck &quot;in a nutshell
  lapped in silk&quot;! In chemistry, what strides! In astronomy, what
  perturbations and changes! In history, what do we not owe to the
  amiable authors who, dipping their pens in whitewash, have reversed
  the judgments of ages on Nero and Henry VIII.! In genealogy, what
  thanks must we pay to Darwin! Geographical Science alone, stolid in
  its insolent fixity, has not moved: the location of Thebes and
  Memphis is what it was in the days of Cheops and Rameses. And so poor
  in <span class="pagenum">[pg 17]</span> intellect are our professors
  of geodesic lore that London continues to be, just as it always was,
  in latitude 51° 30&#39; 48&quot; N., longitude 0° 5&#39; 38&quot; W.,
  while the observatory of Paris contentedly sits in latitude 48°
  50&#39; 12&quot; N. and longitude 2° 20&#39; 22-1/2&quot; E. from the
  observatory of Greenwich! This disgracefully stationary condition of
  the science cannot much longer be permitted.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And how,&quot; said the baron, &quot;will it be
  changed?&quot; and he poked the fire to conceal a yawn. Excellent
  man! his time latterly had been more given to the investigation of
  opera than of the exact sciences.</p>

  <p>&quot;Through my theory of Progression and Proportion in
  geographical statistics, by which the sources of the Nile can be
  easily determined from the volume and speed of that current, while
  the height of the mountains on the far side of the moon will be but a
  pleasing sum in Ratio for a scholar&#39;s vacations. Nor will
  anything content me, my dear Hohenfels, till this somewhat
  theoretical method of traveling is displaced by bodily progression;
  till these easy excursions of the mind are supplemented by material
  extensions; till the foot is pressed where the brain has leaped; and
  till I, then for the first time a traveler, stand behind the lunar
  rim, among the &#39;silent silver lights and darks undreamed
  of!&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am unable to appreciate your divagations,&quot; humbly
  observed Hohenfels, &quot;though I always thought your language
  beautiful. Meantime, my hat is spoiled in coming hither, and you have
  the effrontery to write bucolics to me during the most frightful
  weather of the year. Once for all, do you refuse me an
  um&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>He did not finish his sentence. A world of sunshine burst like a
  bomb into the chamber, and our eyes were dazzled with the splendor: a
  sturdy beam shot directly into the fireplace, and the embers turned
  haggard and gray, and quickly retired from the unequal contest. I
  opened the window. A warm air, faint with the scent of earth and
  turf, invaded the apartment, and the map-like patches of dampness on
  the asphaltum pavement were rapidly and visibly drying away.</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;m off!&quot; said Hohenfels, with a rapid movement of
  retreat.</p>

  <p>&quot;But you are forgetting your&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What, my gloves?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, the umbrella.&quot; And I presented him the heaviest and
  longest and oldest of my collection. He laughed: it was a hoary
  canopy which we had used beside the Neckar and in
  Heidelberg&#8212;&quot;a pleasant town,&quot; as the old song says,
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 18]</span> &quot;when it has done
  raining.&quot; We sealed a compact over the indestructible German
  umbrella. I agreed to defer for a fortnight my departure for Marly:
  on his side he made a solemn vow to come there on the first of May,
  and there receive in full and without wincing the particulars of my
  Progressive Geography. As he passed by the window I took care that he
  should catch a glimpse of me seated by accident in a strong light, my
  smoking-cap crowded down to my spectacles, and my nose buried in my
  old geographers.</p>

  <p>For the next few days the weather supported the side of Hohenfels.
  It scattered rain, sunshine and spits of snow. At last the sun got
  the upper hand and remained master. The wisterias tumbled their
  cataracts of blue blossoms down the spouts; rare flowers, of minute
  proportions, burst from the button-holes of the young horsemen going
  to the Bois; the gloves of the American colony became lilac;
  hyacinths, daffodils and pansies moved by wagon-loads over the
  streets and soared to the windows of the sewing-girls. Overhead, in
  the steaming and cloud-marbled blue, stood the April sun.
  &quot;Apelles of the flowers,&quot; as an old English writer has
  styled him, he was coloring the garden-beds with his rarest enamels,
  and spreading a sheet of varied tints over the steps of the
  Madeleine, where they hold the horticultural market.</p><a href=

  <p>This sort of country ecstasy, this season at once stimulating and
  enervating, tortured me. It disturbed my bibliophilist labors, and
  gave a twang of musty nausea even to the sweet scent of old
  binding-leather. I was as a man caught in the pangs of removing,
  unattached to either home; and I bent from my windows over the
  throngs of festal promenaders, taciturn and uneasy. I fancied that
  wings were sprouting from my brown dressing-robe, and that they were
  the volatile wings of the moth or dragon-fly. But to establish myself
  at Marly before the baron, would not that be a breach of compact?
  Would he not make it a <i>casus belli</i>? Luckily, we were getting
  through April: to-morrow it would be the twenty-eighth.</p>

  <p>On that memorable morning the sun rose strong and bright, and
  photographed a brilliant idea upon my cerebellum.</p>

  <p>I would undertake a pedestrian attack upon Marly by winding my way
  around the suburbs of the capital. What more appropriate, for a
  profound geographer and tourist, <span class="pagenum">[pg 19]</span>
  than to measure with my walking-stick that enormous bed of gypsum, at
  the centre of which, like a bee in a sugar-basin, Paris sits and
  hums?</p>

  <p>The notion gained upon me. Perhaps it was the natural reaction
  from the Mountains of the Moon; but in my then state of mind no
  prospect could appear more delicious than a long tramp among the
  quiet scenes through which the city fringes itself off into rurality.
  Those suburbs of blank convent walls! those curves of the Seine and
  the Marne, blocked with low villages, whose walls of white, stained
  with tender mould and tiled with brown, dipped their placid
  reflections into the stream! those droll square boats, pushing out
  from the sedges to urge you across the ferry! those long rafts of
  lumber, following, like cunning crocodiles, the ins and outs of the
  shallow Seine! those banks of pollard willows, where girls in white
  caps tended flocks of geese and turkeys, and where, every
  silver-spangled morning, the shore was a landscape by Corot, and
  every twilight a landscape by Daubigny! How exquisite these pictures
  became to my mind as I thought them forth one by one, leaning over a
  grimy pavement in the peculiar sultriness of the year&#39;s first
  warmth!</p>

  <p>&quot;Quick, Charles! my tin botany-box.&quot;</p>

  <p>I could be at Marly on the first of May at the dinner hour as
  punctually as Hohenfels&#8212;before him, maybe. And after what a
  range of delicious experience! How he would envy me!</p>

  <p>&quot;Is monsieur going to travel all alone?&quot; said keen old
  Charles, taking the alarm in a minute. &quot;Why am I not to go along
  with monsieur?&quot;</p>

  <p>The accent of primitive fidelity was perfect. I observed casually,
  &quot;I am going on a little journey of thirty-six hours, and alone.
  You can pack everything up, and go on to Marly as usual. You may go
  to-morrow.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Shall I not go along with monsieur, then?&quot; repeated
  Charles, with a turn for tautology not now for the first time
  manifested.</p>

  <p>&quot;What for? Am I a child?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Surely not&#8212;on the contrary. But, though Monsieur Paul
  has a sure foot and a good eye, and is not to say getting old, yet
  when a person is fifty it is not best for a person to run about the
  streets as if a person was a young person.&quot;</p>

  <p>It was Josephine who did me the honor to address me the last
  remark.</p>

  <p>I confess to but forty-five years of age; Hohenfels, quite
  erroneously, gives me forty-eight; Josephine, with that raw alacrity
  in leaping at computations peculiar to the illiterate, oppressed me
  with fifty. Which of us three knew best? I should like to ask. But it
  is of little consequence. The Easterns generally vaunt themselves on
  not knowing the day of their birth. And wisdom comes to us from the
  East.</p>

  <p>I decided, for reasons sufficient to myself, to get out of Paris
  by the opposite <span class="pagenum">[pg 20]</span> side. I
  determined to make my sortie by way of the Temple Market and the
  Belleville abattoirs. On the thirtieth of April, at an ambitiously
  early hour, wearing my gardening cap, with my sketch-book sticking
  out of my pocket, my tin box in one hand and my stout stick in the
  other, I emerged among the staring porters of the neighboring houses,
  and it was in this equipment that I received the renewed lamentations

  <p>&quot;Will you dare to go along the Boulevard looking like that,
  sir?&quot; said Josephine.</p>

  <p>&quot;A gentleman in a cap! They&#39;ll take you for a
  bricklayer&#8212;indeed they will, sir,&quot; said Charles; &quot;or
  rather for a milkman, with his tin can. I can&#39;t stand that: I
  will carry it rather myself, though I feel my rheumatics on these
  damp pavements.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Monsieur Paul must take a cab&#8212;at least to the barrier:
  it will not be pleasant to make a scandal in the street.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Who will tend Monsieur Paul these two days, now?&quot; This
  was uttered with manly grief by Charles.</p>

  <p>&quot;And whoever will cook for him along the road?&quot; It was
  Josephine who asked the question with a heavy sigh.</p>

  <p>To make an end of this charming scene of Old Virginia
  faithfulness, I put my best leg out and departed with gymnastic
  sprightliness. An instant after I turned my head.</p>

  <p>Charles and Josephine were fixed on the doorstep, following me
  with their regards, and I believed I saw a tear in the left eye of
  each. What fidelity! I smiled in a sort of indulgent and baronial
  manner, but I felt touched by their sensibility.</p>

  <p>Come on! It is but a twenty-four hours&#39; separation.</p>

  <p>Go forth, then, as I remember saying long ago, without fear and
  with a manly heart, to meet the dim and shadowy Future.</p>

  <p>In 1832 a few adventurous men obtained a charter for a railroad
  from Baltimore to Port Deposit: other charters were granted by
  Delaware and Pennsylvania in succeeding years, and at last in 1838
  all were consolidated as the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore
  Railroad Company, and became a through all-rail line, interrupted
  only by the Susquehanna and some minor water-courses, under one
  management, beginning at Philadelphia and ending at Baltimore. But
  the country was too young and weak to make this a strong road, either
  in capital or business. It struggled along with a heavy debt, poor
  road-bed, imperfect rail (in some parts the old strap rail), few
  locomotives and cars, and inconvenient dépôts, making but little
  progress up to 1851, when Mr. Samuel M. Felton was brought from
  Boston to assume the presidency.</p>

  <p>Seeing the actual and future importance of the line, some Eastern
  men <span class="pagenum">[pg 21]</span> bought up the stock, put in
  the necessary money and encouraged Mr. Felton to begin an entire
  revolution in the road. The road-bed was perfected and widened for a
  double track, new dépôts erected in Baltimore and Philadelphia, new
  rails laid, new branches opened; and whereas Mr. Felton found the
  road with only a single track, 25 locomotives and 308 cars, he left
  it with many miles of double track, its dépôts rebuilt, 49
  locomotives and 1145 cars. When he took the road its locomotives
  traveled 312,840 miles per year, and earned $718,010, at a cost of
  $252,184.54: when he left it, borne down by disease, the locomotives
  traveled 780,537 miles per year, at a cost of $1,960,649. The capital
  stock in 1851 was $3,850,000, and paid three and a half per cent.: it
  is now $13,486,250, and pays eight per cent.</p>

  <p>When the war broke out in 1862 this road was the key of the
  continent, and the fact that it was officered and controlled by
  Northern and energetic men saved it from destruction or becoming an
  engine in the hands of our enemies. Over it hundreds of thousands of
  soldiers and citizens were carried to the front, and millions of tons
  of merchandise and supplies were poured into the
  quarter-master&#39;s, commissary&#39;s and medical departments all
  along the line.</p>

  <p>In 1864, worn out by disease, the able manager laid down his
  authority, to be taken up by another vigorous New England man, who in
  his turn has given almost life-blood to carry the road on to
  greatness.</p>

  <p>Since 1864 the advance in earnings has not been so great as in the
  four preceding years, because of the necessary reduction in travel
  and transportation since the war. But enormous improvements have been
  made, thousands of steel rails have been laid, locomotives, freight
  cars and passenger cars of the most beautiful description have been
  added to the stock, new dépôts made (some of the finest in the
  country), a new line planned and executed, carrying the road from the
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 22]</span> meadows and marshes of the
  Delaware through the valleys and beautiful rolling uplands of
  Delaware county to Chester, avoiding all danger from floods, and
  going over or under twenty-seven streets to enter the city without
  possible peril to life or limb. A whole railroad system subsidiary to
  this road has been developed in Delaware, and to-day, with the best
  road-bed, double tracks, steel rails, the best locomotives, the best
  passenger cars in the country, supplied with all the modern
  improvements of brake, platform and signal, and a perfectly drilled
  corps of subordinates, this road may challenge the attention of the
  country, and be pointed out as one of the best evidences of the
  growth and prosperity of Philadelphia.</p>

  <p>The dépôt in Philadelphia, at the corner of Broad street and
  Washington avenue, is a large and spacious building, which does not
  pretend to be a model of domestic architecture, but is roomy and
  reasonably well ventilated. The bell rings, we take our seats and
  move out through the usual coal-yards and shanties and suburbs,
  passing the United States Arsenal, until we reach Gray&#39;s Ferry,
  where we see the Schuylkill, beautiful at high tide, the high banks
  opposite once a famous estate, now the seat of the Almshouse, where
  four thousand paupers live in the winter and about fifteen hundred in
  the summer. So mild and pleasant is this climate that the majority of
  the paupers creep out, like the blue bottleflies, with the coming of
  spring, preferring to sleep in barns or under the green trees all the
  summer, rather than endure the hard beds, discipline and regular
  habits of the Almshouse. The rains of summer may fill their old bones
  with rheumatism for winter, but there are charms in the life of the
  stroller, who feeds to-day at a farm-house, or works a few hours
  to-morrow for a trifle to get whisky and tobacco, but has no notes to
  pay, no house to maintain, no servants to support.</p>

  <p>Gray&#39;s Ferry is an old historic name, for here Washington and
  the men of the Revolution crossed again and again. The old rope ferry
  was succeeded by the old horse ferry, and now there are three
  railroads here&#8212;the Darby Improvement, the Junction (which goes
  to West Philadelphia and makes the connection for the great Southern
  Air-line), and the old line, which leads us out, through the old
  Bartram Gardens, where an enthusiastic botanist made the first and
  best collection of trees and plants in this country, on to the
  marshes of the Delaware. The mighty river, widening into a bay, flows
  on to the ocean, its bosom furrowed by thousands of keels and
  whitened by myriad sails. We look over wide acres of marshes, now
  green with the tender colors of spring, the corn-fields of the higher
  portion giving by their brown earth beautiful contrasts of color, the
  rows of corn just coming into sight. All over these meadows stand
  huge oak trees and elms, amongst whose branches the vessels seem to
  glide. But beautiful as the scene is, it is a bad place for a
  railroad, for when the great river rushes down swollen by some
  freshet, and is met by the incoming tide, <span class="pagenum">[pg
  23]</span> the water sets back over the marshes and threatens to
  sweep away the track or put out the fires of the locomotives; and to
  cross streams and tideways many draw-bridges, with their attendant
  dangers, must be maintained. To avoid all these difficulties, Mr.
  Hinckley planned the change which is known as the Darby Improvement,
  carrying the road from Gray&#39;s Ferry to Chester over and through
  the high lands of Darby and Ridley. We shall no longer hear the
  brakeman shout out &quot;Gibson&#39;s,&quot; &quot;Lazaretto,&quot;,
  &quot;Tinicum&quot; (called by the Indians <i>Tenecunck</i>),
  &quot;Crum Creek.&quot; We shall no longer wonder that the train
  should be stopped for so few passengers to get on or off,
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 24]</span> for in future our car will take
  us over a road-bed so perfectly laid with steel rails that a full
  glass of water will not spill as the train hurries on through a
  thickly settled country. Look quickly from the window at the country
  you are traversing: see the beautiful station at Bonnaffon, and the
  magnificent oak tree, worth a hundred stations, that stands in a
  field just beyond. We cannot enumerate all the beauties and objects
  of interest that line the road: every valley opens a pleasant view,
  every hill is covered with handsome houses, comfortable farmeries or
  superb trees. Before the road was made, these lands, lying on a ridge
  high above the river, perfectly healthy and offering the most
  desirable homes for city people, were inaccessible, but now they can
  be reached, and have been already appreciated. Most of the land has
  grown too valuable for farming, and has been bought up and laid out
  with different degrees of care for suburban residences.</p><a name=

  <p>Darby is one of the oldest towns in the State, and contributes
  largely to the business of the road. Mills were built here in 1696,
  and it was divided into Upper and Lower Darby in 1786. The first of
  the new towns is Sharon Hill, where a large amount of land has been
  laid out in the rectangular method, and already many of the lots are
  sold to actual settlers: a machine-shop has been established, and the
  railroad has built a very nice station for passengers.</p>

  <p>Next to Sharon Hill comes Glenolden, where hill and dale, wood and
  meadow and a beautiful stream, offer all the picturesqueness that can
  charm an enthusiastic or artistic eye, together with good
  building-sites and every advantage that fertile and forest-clad land
  can give to one who would exchange the heat and pavements of a city
  for rural life. From Glenolden it is but a short distance to Norwood
  and to Moore&#39;s Crossing, where the company are erecting turnouts,
  engine-houses, etc., and from here, eight <span class="pagenum">[pg
  25]</span> miles from the city, numerous trains will run to
  Philadelphia to accommodate the workingmen who, it is believed, will
  come out to live on these cool and breezy uplands.</p><a name=

  <p>From Moore&#39;s we soon get to Ridley Park, which was described
  at length in a former Number. The two stations at Ridley are models
  of beauty in their way: the principal station spans the road-bed,
  wide enough here for four tracks, and is probably the most
  picturesque in the country, as well as very convenient. Crum Lynne
  Station is remarkable for the beautiful sculpture of the capitals of
  the pilasters to the architraves of the windows, the architect having
  designed each one for this building, using the flowers and fruits and
  birds and animals of the region for his ornamental work, instead of
  the usual cornice and frieze and capital of Grecian

  <p>But the train sweeps us away from Ridley limits, past Leiperville
  with its primeval railway, and on to . As we round the curve and rush
  through the woods we see on the left the broad river with its
  three-masted schooners, ships and steamers, and on the right the
  spires and houses of the town; and first and predominant the Military
  School of Colonel Hyatt. This school was incorporated by act of
  Legislature in 1862, and is devoted to both civil and military
  education. The studies and drill are so combined as to secure good
  mental and physical culture; and to ensure good military instruction
  the State and the United States have contributed arms of all kinds.

  <p>Chester is one of the oldest towns on the line of the road by
  actual years, but one of the youngest in growth. First called by the
  Indians <i>Mackaponacka</i>, and then by the settlers <i>Upland</i>,
  it had <span class="pagenum">[pg 26]</span> a justice of the peace
  court in 1676. Its court-house was built in 1724. Its first newspaper
  was published in 1819. For many years Chester dozed away in dignified
  quiet as the county-town: its court-house and jail gave it all the
  honor it required. But the streams made good mill-sites, the deep
  waterfront along the river offered splendid wharfage and chances for
  shipbuilding, and, as good luck would have it, a rivalry awoke which
  ended in loading Media with the county buildings and relieving
  Chester. Since then it has doubled and trebled: mills and factories
  are on all sides, and its shipyards are not easily surpassed.
  Roach&#39;s shipyard covers twenty-three acres. The firm make their
  own engines and everything required in iron shipbuilding from keel to
  topmast. They have six vessels now on the stocks, and employ eleven
  hundred men, and have room for sixteen hundred. They have built for
  every trade from the coaster to the East Indiaman, varying in size
  from six hundred to four thousand tons, and their vessels pass
  unchallenged amongst the best in the world.</p><a name="image-0024"

  <p>Nor is trade the only feature of the town. About half a mile from
  the dépôt, on a gentle eminence, is the Crozer Theological Seminary.
  The approach from Chester for the pedestrian, along the shrub-, vine-
  and tree-clad banks of Chester Creek into and across the wide lawn,
  is a delightful walk. The principal building was erected by John P.
  Crozer for a normal school. During the war he gave it to the
  government for a hospital, and when he died in 1866 left it to his
  sons, desiring them to devote it to some benevolent use. They have
  responded in a munificent manner by establishing a school for
  training young men for the ministry, with accommodations for a
  hundred students, houses for the professors, a church, a library
  building, lecture-halls and all the required conveniences for a great
  and successful school. They have added an endowment fund of two
  hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars, the whole gift being about
  three hundred and ninety thousand dollars, and one of the family has
  since given twenty-five thousand dollars as a library fund. The
  seminary was opened in 1868 with fifteen students: there are now
  fifty from all parts of the Union.</p><a name="image-0023" id=

  <p>But the most complaisant conductor of the most accommodating
  special train could not <span class="pagenum">[pg 27]</span> wait any
  longer for us, and we must hurry on through Lamokin, where the
  Baltimore Central, a tributary road, turns off and traverses a most
  picturesque country, round by Port Deposit to Perryville, where it
  again reaches the main road. At Lamokin are works where steel of a
  peculiar kind is manufactured under a European patent. From here the
  road again clings to the shore of the Delaware, and until we reach
  Wilmington the river, with its sails and its blue water, is on the
  left&#8212;on the right a high ridge, which ends in the valley of the
  Shell Pot and Brandywine at Wilmington.</p>

  <p>We flash past Linwood to stop a moment at Claymont, where the
  ridge comes nearer the river and offers superb sites for buildings.
  Why Claymont has not grown more no one seems to know. There are
  schools and churches, fine rolling land, noble river-views, and all
  that can make a country <span class="pagenum">[pg 28]</span> home
  delightful. That the place has attractions for lovers of the
  picturesque may be inferred from the fact that it counts among its
  residents an artist of such wide and well-founded celebrity as Mr.
  F.O.C. Darley, whose delineations of American life and scenery,
  especially in the form of book-illustrations, have been familiar to
  the public for the past thirty years. With so many years of fame, Mr.
  Darley counts but fifty-two of life, and in the enjoyment of vigorous
  health still continues the practice of his art, executing many
  commissions from Europe, where his genius is as highly appreciated as
  at home.</p><a name="image-0026" id="image-0026"><!--IMG--></a>

  <p>But we must stick to our train, which carries us through the Red
  Bank Cut to Ellerslie Station, where occurred the first accident of a
  serious character which has happened on this road for eighteen years,
  and which was due only to a willful violation of orders by an old and
  very trusted conductor. At Ellerslie are the Edgemoor Iron-works of
  Messrs. William Sellers &amp; Co., where every known improvement in
  the manufacture of iron is being tested and applied. The next curve
  in the road shows us the meadows of the Shell Pot and the Brandywine,
  with Wilmington in the distance. The Brandywine, famous in our
  history, runs through as picturesque a valley as there is in America,
  combining all that the climate of Delaware permits in trees, shrubs,
  vines and flowers with the wildness and variety of the valley of the
  Pemigewasset or the wild Ammonoosuck. In this rare valley are mills
  as old as the settlement of the country, and quaint hamlets that seem
  to belong to Europe rather than America.</p>

  <p>At Wilmington the system of the Delaware railroads begins: it
  spreads out over the peninsula of Delaware and the Eastern Shore of
  Maryland like a huge left hand. The thumb touches Chestertown and
  Centreville, the fore finger Oxford, the middle finger Cambridge, the
  ring finger Crisfield, the little finger Lewes; and this hand gathers
  into the main road every year millions of baskets of peaches, and
  millions more of oysters in baskets and sacks, and crates of berries,
  and car-loads of hardwood and lumber. Under the influence of these
  roads the sleepy peninsula is beginning a new career.</p>

  <p>We cannot go down the peninsula, so let us keep on to Baltimore,
  pausing, however, for a moment as we cross Mason and Dixon&#39;s line
  near Elkton. Little did Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon dream, as
  they set that tangent point for the determination of the
  boundary-lines of the three States, how famous they would become. But
  there the simple monument stands in the open fields, and there it
  must remain so long as the three States need a boundary.</p>

  <p>Soon after leaving Mason and Dixon we strike the first of the
  great estuaries of the Delaware and Susquehanna, which are the
  delight of the sportsman, the naturalist and the tourist. No matter
  at what season of <span class="pagenum">[pg 30]</span> the year you
  approach North-east, Principio, the Susquehanna River or
  Stemmer&#39;s Run&#8212;no matter at what time of the day&#8212;the
  views are always fine. The water spreads out in huge widening bays,
  and loses itself in the forest or hides behind some projecting
  headland; and when, as is often the case, the surface of the water is
  actually darkened with large flocks of wild fowl, the variety as well
  as beauty of the scene could not be heightened. Such shooting-ground
  for sportsmen exists nowhere else on this coast easily accessible. At
  Perryville, Havre de Grace, Bush River and many other places the
  chance sportsman can find every accommodation, while clubs of
  gentlemen have leased many of the best points, and established little
  houses where they may be comfortable when the day&#39;s sport is
  over, and where they can leave from season to season boats, decoys
  and all the paraphernalia of the sport. To recount the names of
  canvas-backs, red heads, bald pates and innumerable other ducks, to
  tell of the tens, fifties, hundreds shot in a single day, would add
  nothing to the excitement of any sportsman who has seen from the cars
  the huge flocks of birds rise and sweep out to sea when scared by
  some passing train or boat.</p><a name="image-0028" id="image-0028">

  <p>If every passenger could stop once, and study the Susquehanna
  bridge crossing the river between Perryville and Havre de Grace, he
  would have a most profound respect for its projectors and builders.
  For many years all transport by cars was interrupted here, and
  travelers and merchandise were transported by ferry-boat, causing
  wearisome delays and extra expense. But now a bridge 3273 feet long
  and with 1000 feet of trestling, resting on thirteen huge piers built
  on foundations in water from twenty-seven to sixty feet deep, and
  costing a million and a half of dollars, carries all safely over, and
  defies floods and ice. This bridge, one of the triumphs of
  engineering and a just source of pride to the road, has already saved
  in time and trouble a large percentage of its cost. It was threatened
  the past winter by the ice-pack which filled the river back to Port
  Deposit, and which seemed to promise for some time the destruction of
  that well-named little town. It is hard to believe that in a country
  so extensive as ours, with all kinds of lands and town-sites, any one
  could begin to <span class="pagenum">[pg 31]</span> build a town in
  such a situation. It clings to the broken and rocky shores and
  hillsides as lichens adhere to rocks and to the bark of trees or
  swallows&#39; nests to the eaves of a barn. There it is, however,
  and, judging from its costly houses, churches and business
  appearance, its inhabitants have found it a profitable place to stay
  in. Port Deposit last winter, when the river was filled with ice from
  shore to shore and for miles in both directions, fissured and cracked
  and covered with mud, logs and débris, seemed on the verge of
  destruction; and it was easy to believe that if the river did rise
  suddenly the moving mass of ice, like some huge glacier, would sweep
  away all evidences of humanity, leaving behind only the glacial
  scratches and the <i>roches moutonnées</i>. Overhanging the railroad
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 32]</span> is a very remarkable profile
  rock which has attained some celebrity, and is shown in one of our
  sketches.</p><a name="image-0030" id="image-0030"><!--IMG--></a>

  <p>From Port Deposit to Baltimore the country is more rolling than
  from Perryville to Wilmington, and there are many picturesque points.
  One could find at Gunpowder River and Stemmer&#39;s Run several
  beautiful points of view, but by the time he reaches these places the
  traveler begins to get impatient for the great city, the terminus of
  his wanderings, which soon begins to announce itself by more thickly
  congregated houses, and roads cut straight through hill and valley,
  regardless of cost or the destruction of local charms of hill and
  dale.</p>

  <p>If one were to judge by the streets, he would think Baltimorians
  lived only on oysters, for the new streets seem wholly built of their
  shells, making them very white, glaring and offensive to the
  unaccustomed eye. But the attention is soon diverted from houses and
  roads, to the bay and to Fort McHenry, which lies before the town
  like a sleeping lion. Few forts in the country are more interesting
  or have played a more important part in our military history; but all
  its military reputation is less interesting than the fact that whilst
  confined to a British vessel, one of the fleet unsuccessfully
  bombarding the fort, Francis Key wrote the &quot;Star-Spangled
  Banner,&quot; now a national hymn. A bomb thrown into the fort at
  that time by the British has been preserved on a pillar ever

  <p>At Baltimore we leave the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore
  Railroad, sorry to part from so good a road and one so important to
  the welfare of the country. It is a link in the great system, and one
  kept very bright and well polished by its managers. Their course has
  been to pay only a moderate dividend, and use the rest of the
  earnings to improve the road and its belongings, and to foster the
  interests of the people who use it. Such wise policy must build it
  strongly into the affections and interests of those who live along
  it, and ensure its being each year a better and better-paying
  road.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

  <p>Catharine sprang from her bed at daybreak that morning. She could
  scarcely stop singing in the bath. She had so much to do, so much to
  do! The air blew briskly, the factory bells were clanging, the bees
  buzzed, the pretty white curtains were flapping. It was a busy world,
  and she was busiest of all. Had she not Hugh Guinness&#39;s fate in
  hand? She felt like a lad when he comes of age or makes his first
  venture in business. Jane heard her singing noisily for a while, but
  when breakfast was ready she did not come down.</p>

  <p>She was standing in front of her glass, staring at it as though
  the chubby, insignificant face there were the Sphinx and could answer
  the riddles of life. McCall&#39;s remark had suddenly recurred to
  her: &quot;What is Hugh Guinness to you? You belong to another
  man.&quot; With a flash, Mr. Muller, natty and plump, had stood
  before her, curiously unfamiliar, mildly regarding her through his
  spectacles. <i>Her husband!</i> Why had she never understood that
  until this morning? Her crossed hands lay on her wide blue-veined
  shoulders. She almost tore the flesh from them. &quot;I belong to no
  man!&quot; she cried.</p>

  <p>She could not shake off the thought of him, as she usually did. He
  stood beside her, do what she would&#8212;the fat body and legs, the
  finical dress, the wearisome platitudes, a regiment of blue-coated,
  thick-lipped children behind him.</p>

  <p>&quot;If the best were done for them that could be hoped, they
  would but grow up miniature Mullers; and to think of
  <i>that!</i>&quot; said Kitty. She had given her life to him. If she
  lived to be gray-headed, he alone owned her, mind and body. &quot;If
  I were dead in my coffin, he would put his mild, fat little hand on
  me, and look forward to owning me in heaven! Oh-h!&quot; This last
  was the one unendurable pang to Catharine.</p>

  <p>Jane at the moment thrust her black face in: &quot;He&#39;s come.
  Hurry up, honey! Mr. Muller, ob course. Shell I do up your hair,
  chile?&quot;</p>

  <p>Kitty shook her head and smiled. She would have had a kind smile
  for Jane and her like if she had been held by thumbscrews. Stooping
  to button her gaiters, she caught sight of her face in the glass.
  There were dark hollows under the eyes: they had the look of an
  older, graver woman than she had ever been before. Kitty hung up the
  green dress she had meant to wear, and took down a rose-colored one.
  Mr. Muller was talking down stairs. There was reality. There was her
  work and her husband. Why, she had the account-books of the school in
  her upper bureau-drawer at that moment, and in the lower ones her
  wedding things. Dresses and cloaks all made; and such lovely linen!
  As for Hugh Guinness, he was, after all, but a perplexing shadow, a
  riddle that turned from her the more she tried to make him real. She
  went down.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, Catharine!&quot; He held her hand, patting it between
  his own, which were warm and moist. &quot;I really could not deny
  myself a glimpse of you, though I was sent on an errand by Maria to
  the station. But all roads end for me in the Book-shop. That is
  natural&#8212;he! he!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, it is natural.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It must be only a glimpse, though. I begged of Jane a cup of
  hot tea, to take off the chill of this morning air. Ah, here it is:
  thank you, my good girl. Only a glimpse, for Maria&#39;s business was
  urgent: Maria&#39;s business always is urgent. But I was to intercept
  Doctor McCall on his way to the cars.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Is he going this morning?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes. Not to return, it appears.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Not to return?&quot; Her voice seemed hardly to have the
  energy of a question in it.</p>

  <p>&quot;But I,&quot; with a shrug and significant laugh,
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 36]</span> &quot;am not to allow him to go.
  Behold in me an emissary of Love! You; would not have suspected a
  Mercury in your William, Catharine?&quot; Within the last month he
  had begun to talk down in this fashion to her, accommodating himself
  to her childish tastes.</p>

  <p>&quot;What is Mercury&#39;s errand?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Aha! you curious little puss! How a woman does prick her
  ears at the mention of a love-story! Though, I suppose, this one is
  wellnigh its end. Maria made no secret of it. Doctor McCall, I
  inferred from what she said, had been pouring out his troubles in her
  ear, and she sent me to bring him back to her with the message that
  she had found a way of escape from them. Eh? Did you speak? You did
  not know <i>what</i>, dear?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I did not know that Maria had the right to bring him back.
  They are&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Engaged? Oh, certainly. At least&#8212;It is an old
  attachment, and Maria is such a woman to manage, you know! Is that
  the tea-pot, Jane? Just fill my cup again. Oh yes, I suppose it is
  all settled.&quot;</p>

  <p>Catharine was standing by the window. The wind blew in chilly and
  strong, while Mr. Muller behind her sipped his tea and ambled in his
  talk. Crossing the meadow, going down the road, she saw the large
  figure of a man in a loose light overcoat, who swung in his gait and
  carried his hat in his hand as a boy would do. Even if he had loved
  her, she could not, like Maria, have gone a step to meet him, nor
  intoned the Song of Solomon. But he did not love her.</p>

  <p>She turned to her companion: &quot;There is something I wished to
  say.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In one moment, my dear.&quot; He was sweetening his tea.
  Hanging the silver tongs on the lid, he looked up: &quot;Good God,
  Catharine! what is it?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I wished to tell you&#8212;no, don&#39;t touch me,
  please&#8212;this is a mistake which we have made, and it is better
  to let it go no farther. It ought to end now.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;End? Now?&quot; But he was not surprised. The pale face
  staring at her over the half-emptied cup looked as if it had been
  waiting to hear this; so that they began the subject, as it were, in
  the middle. So much had already been said between them without words.
  He set the cup down, even in that moment folding his napkin neatly
  with shaking fingers. Kitty did not laugh. She never laughed at him
  afterward. Something in that large, loose figure yonder, going away
  from her to the woman he loved, had whetted her eyesight and her
  judgment. She saw the man at last under Muller&#39;s weak finical
  ways, and the manly look he gave her.</p>

  <p>&quot;You mean that there must be no&#8212;no marriage?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No. I&#39;m very sorry. It has been my fault. But I
  thought&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You thought you loved me, and you do not. Don&#39;t cry,
  Kitty.&quot;</p>

  <p>A long silence followed, which seemed to Catharine like that of
  death. It was noticeable that he did not make a single effort to
  change her resolution or to keep her. It seemed as if he must have
  been waiting for her to waken some day and see the gulf between
  them.</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t cry, Kitty,&quot; he said again, under his breath.
  He stood by the empty fireplace, resting his dainty foot on the
  fender and looking down on it: he took out his handkerchief, shook
  out its folds and wiped his face, which was hot and parched. Kitty
  was sorry, as she said&#8212;sorry and scared, as though she had been
  called on to touch the corpse of one dear to her friends, but whose
  death cost her nothing. That she was breaking an obligation she had
  incurred voluntarily troubled her very little.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, I thought you would say this one day,&quot; he said at
  last. &quot;I think you are right to take care of yourself. I was too
  old a man for you to marry. But I would have done all I could. I have
  been very fond of you,&quot; looking at her.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes. You never seemed old to me sir.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And your work for the poor children? I thought, dear, you
  felt that the Lord called you to that?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;So I did. But I don&#39;t think I feel it so much
  to-day.&quot; Catharine&#39;s eyes were wide with this new terror.
  Was she, then, turning her back on her God?</p><span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 37]</span>

  <p>She was, after all, he thought, nothing but a frightened,
  beautiful child.</p>

  <p>&quot;I should have been too rough for you,&quot; he said. How was
  he to suspect the heights from which she had looked down on his
  softness and flippancy?</p>

  <p>She observed that he said not a word of the preparations he had
  made, the house furnished, the expectant congregation, or the storm
  of gossip and scandal which would follow him as a jilted lover. Was
  the real wound, then, so deep? Or did he overlook such trifles, as
  men do?</p>

  <p>&quot;I did not forget the new dresses and underclothes,&quot;
  thought Kitty, mean and mortified.</p>

  <p>He roused himself as Jane came in: &quot;No, Jane, no more tea.
  Yes, that is my cup on the mantel-shelf.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Dah&#39;s a gen&#39;leman, Miss Kitty. I took him in the
  Book-shop. &#39;T mought be Spellissy &#39;bout de oats. Tink it is
  Spellissy.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You had better go, Catharine,&quot; taking up his hat.</p>

  <p>&quot;It is not important.&quot; The door closed after Jane. She
  came close to him, irresolute. What could she say? She thought, with
  the heat of childishness, that she would give the blood out of her
  body, drop by drop, to comfort him. She wished that she had gone on
  and married him. &quot;But I cannot say that I love him.&quot; This
  was a matter for life and death&#8212;even Kitty&#39;s polite soul
  recognized that&#8212;and not for a civil lie.</p>

  <p>Again the man asserted himself before the woman: &quot;No, there
  is nothing for you to say, Catharine,&quot; smiling. &quot;There are
  some things it is better not to varnish over with words.&quot; He
  took up his hat after a pause, and turned a feeble, uncertain face to
  the window: &quot;I&#8212;I might as well go now: I have a
  prayer-meeting this afternoon.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And when you go you mean never to come back again?&quot;
  cried Kitty, pale and red in a moment. &quot;That&#39;s to be the end
  of it all?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What more can there be? It&#39;s all said.&quot; Yet after
  he had walked to the door he stood on the steps, looking about the
  room which had grown so familiar and dear to him. At Kitty he did not
  look.</p>

  <p>&quot;Will you have a rose?&quot; breaking one hastily from the
  trailing branches at the window. &quot;To remember the old
  Book-shop.&quot; She had never given him anything before.</p>

  <p>He threw it down: &quot;I do not need a rose to make me
  remember,&quot; bitterly. &quot;It <i>is</i> all said, child? You
  have nothing to tell me?&quot; looking furtively at her.</p>

  <p>For a long time she did not speak: &quot;No, nothing.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Good-bye, Kitty.&quot;</p>

  <p>Kitty did not answer him. The tears ran hot and salt over her
  round cheeks as she watched the little man disappear through the
  walnuts. She went up stairs, and, still crying, chose one or two
  maudlin sonnets and a lock of black hair as mementoes to keep of him.
  She did keep them as long as she lived, and used frequently to sigh
  over them with a sentimental tenderness which the real Muller never
  had won from her.</p><a name="berrytownchxii" id="berrytownchxii">
  <!-- H2 anchor --></a>

  <h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

  <p>Miss Muller&#39;s message was never delivered, but Doctor McCall
  did not leave Berrytown that morning. Going down the road, he had
  caught sight of the old Book-house, and Kitty in her pink wrapper at
  the window. He overheard Symmes, the clerk at the station, say to
  some lounger that Peter Guinness would be at home that day or the
  next. He took his valise to the baggage-room.</p>

  <p>&quot;My business is not pressing,&quot; he said to Symmes.
  &quot;No need to be off until this evening.&quot;</p>

  <p>Perhaps he could see the old man, himself unseen, he thought with
  a boyish choking in his throat. He could surely give one more day to
  the remembrance of that old sweet, hearty boy&#39;s life without
  wronging the wretched ghost of a wife whose hand clutched so much
  away from him.</p>

  <p>Miss Muller, seeing him on the bridge from the windows of her
  room, supposed her message had been given: &quot;He has stayed to
  know how he may win me.&quot; <span class="pagenum">[pg 38]</span>
  For the first time she faced the riddle squarely. In the morning she
  had only wished weakly to keep him beside her.</p>

  <p>He was married. Popular novels offered recipes by the score for
  the cure of such difficulties in love. But Maria was no reader of
  novels. Out of a strict Calvinistic family she and her brother had
  leaped into heterodoxy&#8212;William to pause neatly poised on the
  line where Conventionalism ended; Maria to flounder in an unsounded
  quagmire, which she believed the well of Truth. Five years ago she
  would have felt her chance of salvation in danger if she had spoken
  to a woman who persisted in loving a married man. But five years work
  strange changes in the creeds of young women now-a-days; and
  Maria&#39;s heart was choosing her creed for her to-day, according to
  the custom of her sex.</p>

  <p>She saw Doctor McCall idly leaning over the foot-bridge of the
  creek while he smoked. Passion and brilliancy unknown to them before
  came into her dark eyes: she stretched out her hands as though she
  would have dragged him to her: &quot;Must I give him up because of
  this wife whom he long ago cast off?&quot;</p>

  <p>If she tempted him to marry her? She knew what name her old
  church, her old friends, even her father, who was still living, would
  apply to her. Some of these people with whom she had lately cast in
  her lot had different views on the subject of marriage. Hitherto,
  Maria had kept clear of them. &quot;The white wings of her
  Thought,&quot; she had said, &quot;should not be soiled by venturing
  near impurity.&quot; Now she remembered their arguments against
  marriage as profound and convincing.</p>

  <p>&quot;I could not suggest to him myself this way of escape,&quot;
  she thought, the red dying her face and neck. &quot;I could
  not.&quot; But there was to be a meeting that very evening of the
  &quot;Inner Light Club,&quot; in which Maria was a M.H.G. (Most
  Honorable Guide), and the subject for discussion would be,
  &quot;Shall marriage in the Advanced Consolidated Republic be for
  life or for a term of years?&quot; The profoundest thinkers in the
  society would bring to this vital question all their strength and
  knowledge, and, as they had all made up their minds beforehand
  against bondage and babies, the verdict was likely to be
  unanimous.</p>

  <p>She would contrive that McCall should be one of the audience: the
  wisdom and truth of the arguments would shine in like a great light
  on his life, and he would start up a new man, throwing aside this
  heaviest yoke of social slavery. She would be there (&quot;with a
  black lace mantilla and veil&#8212;so much better than a
  bonnet,&quot; she breathlessly resolved), and at the sight of her he
  would feel the divine force of true love bringing them together, and
  claim her as his own.</p>

  <p>The modern Cleopatra fights upon the rostrum, in lieu of
  &quot;sixty sail,&quot; and uses as weapons newspaper and club,
  instead of purple robe and &quot;cloyless sauce of epicurean
  cook,&quot; but the guerdon of the battle is none the less Mark
  Antony.</p>

  <p>At sundown that evening Doctor McCall was piloted by little Herr
  Bluhm to his office; the Herr, according to his wont, sternly solemn,
  McCall disposed to be hilarious, as suited the pleasant temperature
  of the evening.</p>

  <p>&quot;Club, eh? Inner Light? Oh yes, I&#39;ve no objections. One
  picks up good ideas here, there, anywhere. Meets in your
  office?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes&#8212;a shabby, vulgar place to the outer eye, but so
  many noble souls have there struggled out of darkness into light,
  such mighty Truths have been born there which will guide the age,
  that to me it is the very Holy Ground of Ideas.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;So?&quot; McCall looked at the little man out of the corner
  of his eye, and nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>&quot;It is a Woman&#39;s Club, though men take part in it. But we
  have such faith in the superior integrity and purity of woman&#39;s
  mind when brought to bear on great but hackneyed questions that we
  willingly stand back until she has given her verdict. The magnet,
  sir, pointing out with inexplicable intelligence the true path to
  humanity.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know about that. <span class="pagenum">[pg
  39]</span> Though it&#39;s very likely, very likely,&quot; hurriedly.
  McCall had no relish for argument about it. He was more secure of his
  intellect in the matter of peaches than inner lights. Cowed and awed
  as he could have been by no body of men, he followed Bluhm up a dirty
  flight of stairs into the assemblage of Superior Women. The office
  was by nature a chamber with gaudy wall-paper of bouquets and
  wreaths. Viewed as an office, it was well enough, but in the
  aesthetic, light of a Holy Ground of Ideas it needed sweeping. The
  paper, too, hung in flaps from the damp walls: dusty files of
  newspapers, an empty bird-cage, old boots, a case of medical books, a
  pair of dilapidated trousers filled up one side of the room. A pot of
  clove-pinks in the window struggled to drown with spicy fragrance the
  odor of stale tobacco smoke. There was a hempen carpet, inch deep
  with mud and dust, on the floor. Seated round an empty fireplace, on
  cane chairs and in solemn circle, were about forty followers of the
  Inner Light. McCall perceived Maria near the window, the dusky
  twilight bringing out with fine effect her delicate, beautiful face.
  He turned quickly to the others, looking for the popular type of the
  Advanced Female, in loose sacque and men&#39;s trousers, with bonnet
  a-top, hair cut short, sharp nose and sharper voice. She was not
  there. A third of the women were Quakers, with their calm, benign
  faces for the most part framed by white hair&#8212;women who, having
  fought successfully against slavery, when that victory was won had
  taken up arms against the oppressors of women with devout and
  faithful purpose. The rest McCall declared to himself to be
  &quot;rather a good-looking lot&#8212;women who had,&quot; he guessed
  shrewdly, &quot;been in lack of either enough to eat or somebody to
  love in the world, and who fancied the ballot-box would bring them an
  equivalent for a husband or market-money.&quot;</p>

  <p>A little dish-faced woman in rusty black, and with whitish curls
  surmounted by a faded blue velvet bonnet laid flat on top of her
  head, had the floor: &quot;Mr. Chairman&#8212;I mean Miss
  Chairman&#8212;the object of our meeting this evening is, Shall
  marriage in the Consolidated Republic&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I object!&quot; Herr Bluhm sprang to his feet, wrapping a
  short mantle like a Roman toga across his chest, and wearing a
  portentous frown upon his brow, &quot;There is business of the last
  meeting which is not finished. Shall the thanks of this club be
  presented to the owners of the Berrytown street-cars for free passes
  therein? That is the topic for consideration. I move that a vote of
  thanks be passed;&quot; and he sat down gloomily.</p>

  <p>&quot;I do <i>not</i> second that motion.&quot; A tall woman, with
  the magisterial sweep of shawl and wave of the arm of a cheap
  boarding-house keeper, rose. &quot;I detect a subtle purpose in that
  offer. There is a rat behind that arras. There is a prejudice against
  us in the legislature, and the car company wish no mention of Woman
  Suffrage to be made in Berrytown until their new charter is granted.
  Are we so cheaply bought?&#8212;bribed by a dead-head
  ticket!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The order of the day,&quot; resumed the little widow
  placidly, &quot;is, Shall marriage in the Consol&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Legislature!&quot; piped a weak voice in the crowd.
  &quot;They only laugh at us in the legislature.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Let them laugh: they laughed at the slave.&quot; The speaker
  hurled this in a deep bass voice full at McCall. She was a
  black-browed, handsome young woman, wrapped in a good deal of
  scarlet, who sat sideways on one chair with her feet on the rung of
  another. &quot;How long will the world dare to laugh?&quot; fixing
  him fiercely with her eye.</p>

  <p>&quot;Upon my word, madam, I don&#39;t know,&quot; McCall gasped,
  and checked himself, hot and uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>A fat, handsomely-dressed woman jolted the chair in front of her
  to command attention: &quot;On the question of
  marriage&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Address the chair,&quot; growled Bluhm.</p>

  <p>&quot;Miss Chairman, I want to say that I ought to be qualified to
  speak on marriage, being the mother of ten, to say nothing of twice
  twins.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The question before the house is the <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 40]</span> street-car passes,&quot; thundered Bluhm.
  &quot;I move that we at least thank them for their offer. When a cup
  of tea is passed me, I thank the giver: when the biscuits are handed,
  I do likewise. It is a simple matter of courtesy.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I deny it,&quot; said the black-browed female with a tone of
  tragedy. &quot;What substantial tea has been offered? what biscuits
  have been baked? It is not tea: it is bribery! It is not biscuits: it
  is corruption!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I second Herr Bluhm&#39;s motion.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Miss Chairman, put the question on its passage.&quot;</p>

  <p>A mild old Quakeress rose, thus called on: &quot;Thee has made a
  motion, Friend Bluhm, and Sister Carr says she seconds it; so it
  seems to me&#8212;Indeed I don&#39;t understand this parliamentary
  work.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You&#39;re doing very nicely.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;All right!&quot; called out several voices.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why should we have these trivial parliamentary forms?&quot;
  demanded the Tragic Muse, as McCall called her. &quot;Away with all
  worn-out garments of a degraded Past! Shall the rebellious serf of
  man still wear his old clothes?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But,&quot; whispered McCall to Bluhm, &quot;when will the
  great thinkers you talked of begin to speak on those mighty
  truths&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Patience! These are our great thinkers. The logical heads
  some of them have! Woman,&quot; standing up and beginning aloud,
  apropos to nothing&#8212;&quot;Woman is destined to purify the
  ballot-box, reform the jury, whiten the ermine of the judge.
  [Applause.] When her divine intuitions, her calm reason, are brought
  into play&#8212;&quot; Prolonged applause, in the midst of which
  Bluhm, again apropos to nothing, abruptly sat down.</p>

  <p>&quot;The order of the day,&quot; said the little woman in black,
  &quot;is, Shall marriage&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What about the car company?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Let&#39;s shelve that.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The question of marriage,&quot; began Bluhm, up again with a
  statelier wrap of his toga, &quot;is the most momentous affecting
  mankind. It demands free speech, the freest speech. Are we resolved
  to approach it in proud humility, giving to the God within ourselves
  and within our neighbor freedom to declare the truth?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; &quot;Ay!&quot; from forty voices. Maria, pale and
  trembling, watched McCall.</p>

  <p>&quot;Free speech is our boast,&quot; piped the widow. &quot;If
  not ours, whose?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Before you go any farther,&quot; said the Muse with studied
  politeness, &quot;I have a question to put to Herr Bluhm. Did you did
  you not, sir, in Toombs&#39;s drug-store last week, denominate this
  club a caravan of idiots?&quot; A breathless silence fell upon the
  assembly. Bluhm gasped inarticulately. &quot;His face condemns
  him,&quot; pursued his accuser. &quot;Shall such a man be allowed to
  speak among us? Ay, to take the lead among us?&quot;</p>

  <p>Cries of &quot;No!&quot; &quot;No!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What becomes of your free speech?&quot; cried Bluhm, red and
  stammering with fury. &quot;I was angry. I am rough, perhaps, but I
  seek the truth, as those do not who&quot;&#8212;advancing and shaking
  his shut hand at the Muse&#8212;&quot;who &#39;smile and smile, and
  are a villain still.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The order of the day&quot;&#8212;the widow&#39;s voice rose
  above the din tranquilly&#8212;&quot;<i>is</i> Shall marriage in the
  Consolidated Republic be contracted for life or for a term of
  years?&quot;</p>

  <p>The next moment Maria felt her arm grasped. &quot;Come out of
  this,&quot; whispered McCall, angry and excited. &quot;This is no
  place for you, Maria. Did you hear what they are going to
  discuss?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; as he whisked her out of the door.</p>

  <p>&quot;Then I&#39;m sorry for it. Such things oughtn&#39;t to be
  mentioned in a lady&#39;s presence. If I had a sister, she should not
  know there was such a thing as bigamy. Good God!&quot; wiping his
  forehead with his handkerchief, &quot;if women are not pure and
  spotless, what have we to look up to? And these shallow girls, who
  propose to reform the world, begin by dabbling with the filth of the
  gutter, if they do no worse?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Shallow girls?&quot; He was so big and angry that she felt
  like a wren or sparrow in his hold. But the stupidity of him! the
  blind idiocy! She eyed him <span class="pagenum">[pg 41]</span> from
  head to foot with a bitterness and contempt unutterable&#8212;a
  handsome six-foot animal, with his small brain filled with smaller,
  worn-out prejudices! The way of escape had been set before him, and
  he had spurned it&#8212;and her!</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t see what it can matter to you,&quot; she said
  politely, disengaging herself, &quot;whether I make friends with
  these people and am stained with the filth of the gutter or
  not?&quot; She had a half-insane consciousness that she was playing
  her last card.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, to be sure it matters. You and I have been good friends
  always, Maria, and I don&#39;t like to see you fellowship with that
  lot. What was it Bluhm called them?&quot; laughing. &quot;That was
  rough in Bluhm&#8212;rough. They&#39;re women.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You are going?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In the next train, yes, I waited to see a&#8212;a friend,
  but he did not come. It&#39;s just as well, perhaps,&quot; his face
  saddened. &quot;Well, good-bye, Maria. Don&#39;t be offended at me
  for not approving of your friends. Why, bless my soul! such talk
  is&#8212;it&#39;s not decent;&quot; and with a careless shake of the
  hand he was gone.</p>

  <p>Maria told herself that she despised a man who could so dismiss
  the great social problem and its prophets with a fillip of his thumb.
  She turned to go in to the assemblage of prophets. They were all that
  was left her in life. But she did not go in. She went to her bare
  chamber, and took Hero up on her lap and cried over him.
  &quot;<i>You</i> love me, doggy?&quot; she said.</p>

  <p>She had an attack of syncope that night, for which no pack or sitz
  proved a remedy; and it was about that time that the long and painful
  affection of the ulnar nerve began which almost destroyed her
  usefulness as a surgeon.</p><a name="berrytownchxiii" id=
  "berrytownchxiii"><!-- H2 anchor --></a>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

  <p>That evening, as Miss Muller sat alone with Hero in her room (just
  as the neuralgia was beginning), the door opened and Miss Vogdes
  entered. The girl turned a harassed, worn countenance toward Maria,
  and stumbled awkwardly over her words. It was not, certainly, because
  she was conscious that she had used William Muller cruelly. She had
  forgotten that William Muller lived.</p>

  <p>She had been thinking of Maria all day. She was the woman whom
  Doctor McCall loved. By the time night came Kitty had a maddening
  desire to see again this woman that he loved&#8212;to touch her, hear
  her speak. She had been used to regard her as a disagreeable bore,
  but now she looked on her as a woman set apart from all the world.
  She had made a poor excuse to come up to the Water-cure: now that she
  was there she half forgot it. Maria&#39;s delicate face, her quick
  grace of motion, her clear, well-bred voice, were so many stabs to
  Kitty, each of which touched the quick. Maria&#39;s hair hung loosely
  over her shoulders: it was very soft and thick. She wondered if
  Doctor McCall had ever touched it. &quot;Though what right have
  <i>I</i> to know?&quot; For some reason this last was the pang that
  tugged hardest at Kitty&#39;s heart.</p>

  <p>&quot;I brought a message for Doctor McCall,&quot; she said,
  fumbling in her pocket&#8212;&quot;that is, for you to deliver to
  him, Maria.&quot;</p>

  <p>Miss Muller turned her shoulder to her: &quot;Doctor McCall is
  gone&#8212;I don&#39;t know where.&quot;</p>

  <p>She started forward: &quot;Gone? To come again, you
  mean?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No&#8212;never to come back!&quot; vehemently.</p>

  <p>Kitty stood by her silent a moment: &quot;William told me that you
  sent for him, that he loved you, Maria&#8212;that you would be
  married some of these days.&quot;</p>

  <p>Miss Muller hesitated: there was no use in revealing her
  humiliation to this girl: &quot;There was an obstacle in the way.
  Doctor McCall is peculiarly hedged in by circumstances.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And you could not find the way of escape?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No.&quot; She did not see the flash of triumph on the
  girl&#39;s face, or notice when she went out.</p><span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 42]</span>

  <p>Kitty was human. &quot;At least,&quot; she muttered going down the
  hill, &quot;I shall not have to see <i>her</i> his wife.&quot; When
  she had reached the Book-shop she took from her pocket a coarse
  yellow envelope containing a telegram directed to Hugh Guinness in
  his father&#39;s care. She turned it over. This was a bond between
  them which even Maria did not share: she alone knew that he was Hugh
  Guinness.</p>

  <p>&quot;What am I to do with this?&quot;</p>

  <p>Doctor McCall was gone, never to come back. It was like touching
  his hand far off to read this message to him. Besides, Kitty was
  curious. She opened the envelope.</p>

  <p>&quot;Come to me at once. You will soon be free,&quot; without any
  signature but an initial. The melodramatic mystery of it would have
  cautioned knowing women, but Kitty was not knowing.</p>

  <p>&quot;If he had received this an hour ago, the &#39;way of
  escape&#39; would have been found. He would have been free to marry
  Maria.&quot; So much she understood. She sat down and was quiet for
  half an hour. It was the first wretched half hour of her
  life&#8212;so wretched that she forgot to cry.</p>

  <p>&quot;It would make him very happy to marry Maria,&quot; she said,
  getting up and speaking aloud. Then she opened the door and went up
  to her chamber, her thoughts keeping time with her swift motions. It
  seemed to her that she still spoke aloud. &quot;If I were a man I
  could go to this house in Philadelphia and receive this message,
  which will set him free&quot; (beginning to fold the dresses in her
  closet). &quot;It will never reach him otherwise. I could find and
  bring him to Maria. But I never was five miles from Berrytown in my
  life, <i>I</i> never could go&quot; (dragging out a great trunk and
  packing the dresses into it). &quot;It would be a friendly thing for
  some man to do for him. Maria could not do so much&quot; (cramming in
  undergarments enough for a year&#39;s wear). &quot;If I were a man!
  He&#39;d not snub me then as he does now, when I am only Kitty. If
  this could be done it would bring happiness for life to him.&quot;
  (The trunk was packed as she had seen her mother&#39;s. She was on
  her knees, trying to force down the lid, but her wrists were too
  weak.) &quot;He would come back at once. How lovely Maria looked in
  that black lace mantilla! He would kiss her mouth and smooth her
  hair.&quot; (Kitty, still kneeling, was staring at the wall with pale
  cheeks and distended eyes. The lock snapped as it shut. She rose and
  began putting on her gray hat and veil.) &quot;No woman could go to
  the city through that dark; and there is a storm coming. If I did it,
  what would he care for me? I am only Kitty. I would sit in the window
  here alone year after year, growing into a neglected old maid, and
  watch him go by with his happy wife and children. I need not
  interfere. I can throw the telegram into the fire and let them both
  go their ways. What are they to me?&quot; She had buttoned her sacque
  and gloves, and now went up to the glass. It was a childish face that
  she looked at, but one now exceptionally grave and reserved.</p>

  <p>She walked quickly down and tapped at the kitchen door: &quot;When
  the porter comes for my trunk, Jane, give it to him. Tell my mother
  when she comes it was necessary for me to leave home to help a
  friend. I shall be back in a few days&#8212;if I am alive.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;De Lord be good to us, honey!&quot; Jane stood aghast. Kitty
  came suddenly up to the old woman and kissed her. She felt quite
  alone in the world in beginning this desperate undertaking. The next
  moment she passed the window and was gone.</p>

  <p>Miss Muller, with a satchel and shawl-strap, would have started
  coolly at an hour&#39;s notice alone for the Yosemite or Japan. But
  Kitty, with the enormous trunk, which was her sole idea of travel,
  set out through the night and storm, feeling death clutching at her
  on every side.</p>

  <p>An hour after nightfall that evening the Eastern express-train
  reached the station beyond Berrytown, bringing home Peter and his
  wife, triumphant. Her money had covered a larger extent of muslins
  and laces than she hoped for&#8212;enough to convert the raw
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 43]</span> school-girl Kitty, when she was
  married, into a leader of church-going fashion.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Guinness leaned back in the plush car-seat, planning the
  wedding-breakfast. That was now her only care. Out in the world of
  shops and milliners her superstitious dread of a man long since dead
  had seemed to her absurd.</p>

  <p>&quot;I have had some unreasonable fears about Kitty,&quot; she
  said to Peter, who was beginning to nod opposite to her. &quot;But
  all will be well when she is Muller&#39;s wife.&quot;</p>

  <p>Another train passed at the moment they reached the station. Her
  eye ran curiously over the long line of faces in the car-windows to
  find some neighbor or friend.</p>

  <p>She touched Peter&#39;s arm: &quot;How like that is to
  Kitty!&quot; nodding toward a woman&#39;s head brought just opposite
  to them. The train began to move, and the woman turned her face
  toward them: &quot;Merciful Heaven, it <i>is</i> Kitty!&quot;</p>

  <p>The engine sent out its shrill foreboding whistle and rushed on,
  carrying the girl into the darkness. Behind her in the car as it
  passed her mother saw the face of Hugh Guinness.</p><a name=
  "berrytownchxiv" id="berrytownchxiv"><!-- H2 anchor --></a>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

  <p>Doctor McCall had been five minutes too late for the first train,
  and so had been delayed for the express in which Kitty started on her
  adventure. Commonplace accidents determine commonplace lives, was a
  favorite maxim of the Berrytown Illuminati. The Supreme Intelligence
  whom they complimented with respect could not be expected to hold
  such petty trifles or petty lives in His controlling hand.</p>

  <p>Doctor McCall had seen Catharine when she first entered the
  station. Her very manner had the air of flight and secresy. Puzzled
  and annoyed, he sat down in the rear of the car, himself unseen. When
  they reached Philadelphia it was not yet dawn. The passengers rushed
  out of the cars: Kitty sat quiet. She had never slept outside of the
  Book-house before. She looked out at the dim-lighted dépôt, at the
  slouching dark figures that stole through it from time to time, the
  engines, with their hot red eyes, sweeping back and forward in the
  distance, breaking the night with portentous shrieks. Where should
  she go? She had never been in a hotel in her life: she had no money.
  If she ventured into the night she would be arrested, no doubt, as a
  vagrant. She had a gallant heart to take care of Hugh Guinness&#39;s
  life, but her poor little woman&#39;s body was quaking in deadly fear
  for herself. In a moment a decent mulatto woman, whom McCall had
  sent, came from the waiting-room into the deserted car.</p>

  <p>&quot;There is a room for ladies, where you can be comfortable
  until daybreak, madam,&quot; she said respectfully.</p>

  <p>&quot;I am much obliged to you,&quot; said Catharine.</p>

  <p>When she saw how young she was, the mulatto, a motherly body, took
  her into a little inner snuggery used to store packages: &quot;You
  can turn the key, and sleep if you will until morning.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ll not close my eyes until my errand is done,&quot;
  thought Kitty, and sat down in a rocking-chair, placing her satchel
  beside her. In five minutes she was fast asleep. McCall, pacing up
  and down the platform, could see her through the open window. He
  forgot to wonder why she had come. There was a certain neatness and
  freshness about her which he thought he had never observed in other
  women. After her night&#39;s travel her dress fell soft and gray as
  though just taken from the fold, her petticoat, crisp and white,
  peeped in one place to sight. How dainty and well-fitting were the
  little boots and gloves! Where the hair was drawn back, too, from her
  forehead he could see the blue veins and pink below the skin, like a
  baby&#39;s. He did not know before what keen eyes he had. But this
  was as though a breath of the old home when he had been a child, one
  of the dewy Bourbon roses in his father&#39;s garden, had followed
  him to the stifling town. It made the station different&#8212;even
  the morning. Fresh damp winds blew pleasantly from the <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 44]</span> reddening sky. The white marble steps and
  lintels of the street shone clean and bright; the porters going by to
  the freight dépôt gave him good-day cheerfully. In the window the old
  mulatto had some thriving pots of ivy and fragrant geraniums. Even a
  dog that came frisking up the sidewalk rubbed itself in a friendly
  fashion against his legs.</p>

  <p>McCall suddenly remembered a journey he had made long ago, and a
  companion whose breath was foul with opium as her head at night
  rested on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>But there was no need that one woman&#39;s breath should sicken
  him even now with the whole world; and again he stopped in his walk
  to look at Kitty.</p>

  <p>The fresh wind blowing on her wakened her presently. The mulatto
  was anxious to serve her: it was always the case with people of her
  class after Kitty had once spoken to them.</p>

  <p>&quot;I should like fresh water and towels,&quot; she said coolly,
  as though toilet appurtenances were to be found at every street
  corner. The woman paused, and then with a queer smile brought them.
  In a a few moments McCall saw her come out fresher than before.</p>

  <p>&quot;Where is this house?&quot; showing a name and number to the
  mulatto, who read it once or twice, and then looked steadily at
  Kitty.</p>

  <p>&quot;Are you going alone to that place?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

  <p>The woman gave her the directions without further parley, adding
  that it was about six miles distant, and turned away. Catharine
  followed her to thank her, and put a dollar note in her hand. It was
  all the money she had.</p>

  <p>She walked on down the rapidly filling streets&#8212;for miles, as
  she thought. The hurry and rush of the day had begun. The sense of
  nothingness in the midst of this great multitude came upon Kitty. The
  fear, the excitement began to tell on her: yesterday she had eaten
  but little in her pity for Muller. &quot;Which was very foolish of
  me,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;Now I&#39;ve no money to buy
  anything to eat. I have acted in this matter without common
  sense.&quot; The sun lighted up the yellow leaves of the maples along
  the sidewalk. The wind blew strongly up from the rivers. She passed a
  stand with some withered apples and stale cakes, and put her hand in
  her pocket, then with a wistful look went on.</p>

  <p>It was late in the morning before she reached her journey&#39;s
  end. Showing her paper now and then, she had noticed the curious
  inquiring look which both men and women gave her on reading it. She
  found herself at last under a long gray stone wall pierced by an
  iron-knobbed gate. By the side of it a man was setting out on an
  eating-stand a half-eaten ham, chaffy rolls and pies yellow with age.
  The man was an old, cleanly shaven fellow, whose aquiline nose
  reminded her with a twinge of conscience of Mr. Muller.</p>

  <p>&quot;Am I near to this house?&quot; showing her paper.</p>

  <p>&quot;Here,&quot; nodding back at the stone wall, cutting his
  pies.</p>

  <p>&quot;This! What is this place, sir?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Moyamensing Prison.&quot; He finished cutting the pies
  carefully, and then, wiping the knife, looked up at her, and suddenly
  came from behind the stand:</p>

  <p>&quot;You&#39;re not well?&quot; pushing a seat toward her.
  &quot;Here&#39;s some water. Or coffee?&quot;</p>

  <p>She sat down: &quot;Oh, it&#39;s nothing. Only I&#39;ve traveled a
  long way, and I did not know it was a prison I was coming
  to.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Won&#39;t you have some coffee? You don&#39;t look
  rugged.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, thank you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s not what you&#39;ve been used to, of course.
  But hot.&quot; He put the water within her reach and drew aside,
  looking at her now and then. He was used to the pale faces and tears
  of women at that gate. &quot;Though she&#39;s different from them as
  has friends here,&quot; he thought, silencing one or two noisy
  customers by a look. Presently he came up to her: &quot;You&#39;re
  afeard to go in there alone, young lady?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, I am. What shall I do?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I thought as much. Yonder comes the chaplain. I&#39;ll speak
  to him,&quot; going to meet two gentlemen who crossed the
  street.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 45]</span>

  <p>&quot;You wished to see a prisoner?&quot; one of them said, coming
  up to her.</p>

  <p>Kitty was herself again. She stood up and bowed with her
  old-fashioned, grave politeness: &quot;I do not know. It was this
  that brought me here,&quot; handing him the telegram.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah? I remember,&quot; glancing at it. &quot;Number 243 sent
  it, you recollect?&quot; to his companion. &quot;But this is
  addressed to Hugh Guinness?&quot; turning inquiringly to Kitty.</p>

  <p>&quot;I am a&#8212;a member of his family. He was not at home, and
  I came to receive the message for him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Will you go in with us, doctor?&quot; The chaplain turned to
  his companion.</p>

  <p>&quot;Presently. There is a man coming up the street I want to
  see.&quot;</p>

  <p>The chaplain motioned her to follow him, casting a curious glance
  back at her. They passed up into the long stone corridors, tier over
  tier, with the lines of square iron doors, each with its slate
  dangling outside, with a name scrawled on it. He stopped at one,
  opened it and drew back, motioning her to enter.</p>

  <p>Kitty caught sight of the damp wall of a cell, and stopped.</p>

  <p>&quot;Shall I go in with you?&quot; seeing her shiver.</p>

  <p>&quot;No: Mr. Guinness might wish the message kept as private as
  possible.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is very probable. The prisoner is very ill, or you could
  not have a private interview.&quot;</p>

  <p>She went in, and the door closed behind her. It was a moment
  before she could distinguish any object in the dimly lighted cell.
  Then she saw the square window, the cobwebbed walls, and close at
  hand a narrow pallet, on which lay a woman in a coarse and soiled
  night-dress. She was tall and gaunt: one arm was thrown over her
  head, framing a heavy-jawed, livid face, with dull black eyes fixed
  on Catharine.</p>

  <p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; she said.</p>

  <p>Kitty went straight up to her. The foul smell made her head reel.
  But this was only a woman, after all; and one in great bodily
  need&#8212;dying, she thought. Kitty was a born nurse. She
  involuntarily straightened the wretched pillows and touched the hot
  forehead before she spoke: &quot;I came instead of Hugh Guinness. You
  had a message for him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t matter for that,&quot; her
  eyes wandering. The soft touch and the kind face bending over her
  were more to her just now than all that had gone before in her life.
  &quot;It is here the pain is,&quot; moving Kitty&#39;s hand to her
  side. The pain filled the dull eyes with tears. &quot;This is a poor
  place to die in,&quot; trying to smile.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, you are not going to die,&quot; cheerfully. &quot;Let me
  lift you up higher on the pillows. Put your arm about me&#8212;so.
  You&#39;re not too heavy for me to lift.&quot;</p>

  <p>The woman, when she was arranged, took Kitty&#39;s fingers and
  feebly held them to her side. &quot;It is so long since anybody took
  care of me. I sha&#39;n&#39;t live till to-morrow. Don&#39;t leave
  me&#8212;don&#39;t go away.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ll not go away,&quot; said Kitty.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>The man whom the prison physician had waited to meet was Doctor
  McCall. He had followed Kitty so far, unwilling to interfere by
  speaking to her. But when he saw her enter Moyamensing he thought
  that she needed a protector. &quot;Ha, Pollard, is this you?&quot;
  stopping to shake hands. They were old acquaintances, and managed, in
  spite of their profession, to see something of each other every year.
  McCall ran up to town once or twice through the winter, and stayed at
  Pollard&#39;s house, and Pollard managed to spend a week or two with
  him in peach season.</p>

  <p>&quot;I thought I knew your swing, McCall, two squares off.
  Looking for me?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No: I followed a lady, a friend of mine, who has just gone
  in at the gate.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You know her, eh?&quot; eagerly. &quot;A most attractive
  little girl, I thought: She went in with the chaplain to see one of
  the prisoners.&quot;</p>

  <p>McCall paused, his hand on the gate. A horrible doubt stopped his
  heart-beating for an instant. But how utterly absurd it was! Only
  because this black shadow pursued him always could such a fancy have
  come to him. &quot;The prisoner <span class="pagenum">[pg 46]</span>
  is a woman?&quot; with forced carelessness.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes. A poor wretch brought here last spring for shoplifting.
  Her term&#39;s out next week. She has had a sharp attack of
  pneumonia, and has not much strength to bear it: she is a miserable
  wreck from opium-eating.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Opium-eating? Can I go in?&quot; said McCall.</p>

  <p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

  <p>When the woman heard their steps on the corridor she said to
  Catharine, &quot;I hear my husband coming now.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That will be pleasant for you,&quot; kindly, wondering to
  herself what sort of a ruffian had chosen this creature for a mate
  and had the burden of her to carry.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, I know his step,&quot; turning dully to the door. It
  opened, and Hugh Guinness stood on the threshold.</p>

  <p>He halted one brief moment. It seemed to Catharine that he was an
  older man than she had known him.</p>

  <p>&quot;It is you, then, Louise?&quot; he said calmly, going up to
  the bed and looking down on her, his hands clasped, as usual, behind
  him.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, it is I. I thought you would like to see me and talk
  things over before I died, Hugh.&quot; She held out her hand, but he
  did not touch it. Looking at her a moment from head to foot as she
  lay in her unclean garments, he turned to where the other woman
  stood, a ray of light from the window shining on her fair hair and
  innocent face: &quot;Do you know that I am Hugh Guinness,
  Kitty?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I knew that long ago.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>This</i>,&quot; nodding down at the pallet, &quot;is my
  wife. Now do you know why I could not go home to my father or to
  you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;God help us!&quot; ejaculated Pollard. The next moment,
  remembering himself, he put his hand on McCall&#39;s shoulder:
  &quot;I understand. When you were a boy, eh? Never mind: every man
  has his own trouble to carry.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ve been a very real trouble to you, Hugh,&quot; whined
  Louise. &quot;But I always loved you: I always meant to come back to
  you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;When her later husbands had abandoned her.&quot; McCall
  laughed savagely, turning away.</p>

  <p>She started up on the pallet, clenching her bony, dirty hands:
  &quot;There were faults on both sides. I never would have been the
  woman I am if you had loved me. What will you do with me
  now?&quot;</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence in the cell, broken only by the heavy
  breathing of the woman. McCall stood dumb, looking first at Catharine
  and then at his wife.</p>

  <p>&quot;This is what he will do,&quot; said Kitty&#39;s clear, quiet
  tones. &quot;You shall be washed and dressed, and taken home as his
  wife, to live or die as suits God&#39;s will.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Never,&quot; muttered McCall.</p>

  <p>&quot;How soon can she leave this&#8212;this place?&quot; she
  said, turning as if he had not spoken to Pollard.</p>

  <p>&quot;As soon as she is able to be moved. But,&quot; hesitating,
  with a doubtful look at McCall, &quot;is that plan best?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, she&#39;s his wife!&quot; with her innocent eyes wide.
  &quot;He has no right to desert her. She will die if she is not
  properly cared for,&quot; turning to McCall.</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you stay with me: don&#39;t leave me,&quot; holding
  Kitty&#39;s sleeve. &quot;If you would nurse me, I should get
  well.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is impossible that the lady should nurse you,&quot; said
  Pollard.</p>

  <p>Kitty sat down: she began to tremble and turn white. &quot;She has
  nobody but me. I&#39;ll stay,&quot; she said quietly.</p>

  <p>McCall beckoned his fellow-physician out into the corridor.</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear fellow&#8212;&quot; Pollard began.</p>

  <p>&quot;No: I know you sympathize with me. But we will not talk of
  this matter. Is that woman dying?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;m afraid&#8212;that is, I think not. She is decidedly
  better to-day than she was last night. With care she may
  recover.&quot;</p>

  <p>Kitty came out and stood with them in the corridor. McCall looked
  at her with amazement. The shy, silly school-girl, afraid to find her
  way about Berrytown, bore herself in this desperate juncture like the
  sagest of matrons.</p>

  <p>&quot;Is there no hospital to which she can be taken?&quot; she
  said to Pollard.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 47]</span>

  <p>&quot;Yes, of course, of course.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ll go with her there, then. You know,&quot; laying her
  hand on McCall&#39;s arm, &quot;you <i>did</i> marry her. You ought
  to try to help her poor body and soul as long as she lives.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Would you have me take her as my wife again?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Not for an hour!&quot; cried Kitty vehemently. She went into
  the cell, but came back in a moment: &quot;Will you bring me some
  breakfast? I shall not be of much use here until it comes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;She has more of the angel in her than any woman I ever
  knew,&quot; muttered McCall.</p>

  <p>&quot;She has a good deal of common sense, apparently,&quot;
  rejoined Pollard.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Kitty went with McCall&#39;s wife to the hospital, and helped to
  nurse her for a week. Pains and chills and nausea she could help, but
  for the deeper disease of soul, for the cure of which Kitty prayed on
  her knees, often with tears, there was little hope in her simple
  remedies, unless the cure and its evidence lay deep enough for only
  God&#39;s eye to see.</p>

  <p>The woman&#39;s nature, of a low type at birth, had grown more
  brutal with every year of drunkenness and vice. She died at last,
  alone with Kitty.</p>

  <p>&quot;She said, the last thing, &#39;God be merciful to me a
  sinner!&#39;&quot; Kitty told the chaplain. &quot;But I am afraid she
  hardly understood the meaning.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He understood, my dear child. We can leave her with Him, You
  must go home now: you have done all you could. Doctor McCall will go
  with you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, I shall go alone: I came alone.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He will follow you home to Berrytown, then?&quot; for the
  chaplain was but a man, and his curiosity was roused to know the
  exact relation between McCall and this old-fashioned, lovable
  girl.</p>

  <p>Kitty hesitated: &quot;I think he will come to Berrytown again.
  There is some business there which his wife&#39;s death will leave
  him free now to attend to.&quot;</p>

  <p>She went to a sofa and sat down: &quot;I shall be glad to be at
  home,&quot; beginning to cry. &quot;I want to see father.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Broke down utterly,&quot; the chaplain told his wife,
  &quot;as soon as her terrible work was done.&quot;</p>

  <p>As for Kitty, it seemed to her that her work in life and death was
  over for ever.</p>

  <p>&quot;You must come back,&quot; she said when McCall put her in
  the cars, looking like a ghost of herself. &quot;Your father will be
  wanting to see you. And&#8212;and Maria.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Maria? What the deuce is Maria to me?&quot;</p>

  <p>It was no ghost of Kitty that came home that evening. The shy,
  lively color came and went unceasingly, and her eyes sparkled.</p>

  <p>&quot;Poor Maria!&quot; she whispered to her pillow as she went to
  bed&#8212;&quot;poor Maria!&quot;</p><a name="berrytownchxv" id=

  <h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

  <p>It was a long time before he came. Months afterward, one evening
  when the express-train rushed into the dépôt, Catharine went down
  through the walnut trees into the garden. She stopped in the shadow
  as a man&#39;s figure crossed the fields. The air was cool&#8212;it
  was early spring. The clouds in the west threw the Book-house
  into shadow. Hugh Guinness, coming home, could see the narrow-paned
  windows twinkling behind the walnut boughs. It was just as he had
  left it when he was a boy. There was the cow thrusting her head
  through a break in the fence he had made himself; the yellow-billed
  ducks quacked about the pond he had dug in the barnyard; the row of
  lilacs by the orchard fence were just in blossom: they were always
  the latest on the farm, he remembered. He saw Kitty, like the heart
  of his old home, waiting for him. Her white dress and the hair pushed
  back from her face gave her an appearance of curious gentleness and
  delicacy.</p>

  <p>When he came to her he took both her hands in his.</p>

  <p>&quot;You will come to your father now?&quot; she said, frightened
  and pale.</p>

  <p>They walked side by side down the thick rows of young saplings.
  There was a cool bank overgrown with trumpet-creeper. Inside, he
  caught sight of a <span class="pagenum">[pg 48]</span> little recess
  or cave, and a gray old bench on which was just room for two.</p>

  <p>&quot;Will you stop here and sit down one moment?&quot; she
  said.</p>

  <p>It was nothing to him but a deserted spring-house. It was the one
  enchanted spot of Kitty&#39;s life.</p>

  <p>Half an hour afterward they found old Peter playing on his violin
  at the doorstep. Kitty had often planned an effective bringing back
  of Hugh to him, but she forgot it all, and creeping up put her hands
  about his neck. &quot;Father! look there, father!&quot; she
  whispered.</p>

  <p>The Book-house still stands among its walnuts in Berrytown. But a
  shrewd young fellow from New York has charge of it now, who deals
  principally in school-books and publications relative to Reforms and
  raspberries. Old Peter Guinness still holds an interest in it,
  although his chief business is that of special agent for libraries in
  buying rare books and pamphlets. He comes down for two or three weeks
  in winter to look into matters. But since his wife died he makes his
  home in Delaware with his son, who married, as all Berrytown knows,
  Kitty Vogdes after she behaved so shamefully to Mr. Muller.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Guinness died in high good-humor with her son-in-law.
  &quot;Doctor McCall,&quot; she assured her neighbors, &quot;was
  exactly the man she should have chosen for Catharine. She had known
  him from a boy, and knew that his high social position and wealth
  were only his deserts. A member&#8212;vestryman indeed&#8212;of St.
  Luke&#39;s Church, the largest in Sussex county.&quot;</p>

  <p>The farm-people in the sleepy, sunny Delaware neighborhood have
  elected Kitty a chief favorite. &quot;A gentle, good-natured little
  woman, with no opinions of her own. A bit too fond of dress perhaps,
  and a silly, doting mother, but the most neighborly, lovable creature
  alive, after all.&quot;</p>

  <p>Miss Muller was down in St. George&#39;s lecturing last fall, and
  made her mark, as she always does. But the Guinness men were now
  hopelessly conservative. She made her home with Kitty.</p>

  <p>&quot;A fine woman,&quot; old Peter said the morning after she was
  gone.</p>

  <p>&quot;Never knew a woman with a finer mind,&quot; said Hugh.
  &quot;Nor many men.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;She nurses that dog as if it were a baby,&quot; said Kitty
  sharply. &quot;It&#39;s silly! It&#39;s disgusting!&quot;</p>

  <p>Peter twanged his bow on the porch, looking down over the great
  farm-slopes stretching away in the morning light.</p>

  <p>&quot;We have everything to make life good to us, Hugh,&quot; he
  said after Kitty had gone. &quot;And the best thing, to my notion, is
  an old-fashioned woman in the house, with no notion of ruling, like
  that Muller girl and her set.&quot;</p>

  <p>Hugh was romping with his boy: &quot;Do you know your first
  business in this world, sir? To take care of your mother,&quot;
  glancing at the garden, where Kitty, in her pretty white dress, was
  clipping chrysanthemums.</p>

  <p>She rules him and the house and their lives absolutely, with but
  little regard for justice. But he has never suspected it. She hardly
  knows herself that she does it.</p>

  <h2>STRANGE SEA INDUSTRIES AND ADVENTURES.</h2>

  <p>The wrecker on the Florida reefs, who steps from the Peninsula
  into the marine world, will tell you there is nothing so like the
  land as the water. The crystal atmosphere of this land of meridional
  spring, the masses of tawny green in forests of the pine, and the
  deeper foliage of the live-oak and wild-orange, even that fire of
  flower in phaenogamous plants peculiar to the Peninsula, have their
  fellowship and counterparts in the lustrous scenery of the submarine
  world. Even the beauty of moon-like lakes and river springs is
  realized in the salt envelope of the under-world. Washing the keel of
  the submerged vessel, or bursting with a sudden chill through the
  tepid waters of the Gulf, with a sensible difference to feeling and
  to sight, the diver recognizes a river in the strata, a wayside
  spring in the mid-sea fountain.</p>

  <p>As the huge volume of many Florida springs, and their peculiar
  characteristic of sudden sinking, give them a distinguishable
  quality, so the like may be recognized in the fresh-water outbursts
  of the neighboring seas. Silver Spring in Marion county tosses out
  three hundred million gallons per day; Manatee Spring discharges a
  less volume, but is noted for the presence of the sea-cow
  (<i>Trichecus muriatus</i>); Santa Fé, Econfinna, Chipola and Oscilla
  are rivers which, like classic Acheron, descend and disappear with a
  full head&#8212;lost rivers, as they are aptly named. Pass to the
  marine world, and south-west of Bataban, in the Gulf of Xagua (Cuba),
  a river-fountain throws up a broad white disk like a flower of water
  on a liquid stem, visible on the violet phosphorescence of the
  Caribbean Sea. Its impetuous force makes it dangerous to unwary
  crafts; and, to add to its recognizable characteristics, in its pure
  waters is to be found the sea-cow&#8212;found there and in Manatee
  Bay and Spring alone. To the geologist such rivers are not mysteries.
  The lower strata of the limestone formation are hollowed out into
  vast cavernous channels and chambers, through which rolls for ever
  the hoarse murmur of multitudinous waters. It would require the
  conception of a Milton or the stern Florentine who pictured Malebolge
  to depict those hollow passages and lofty galleries, wrought into
  fantastic shapes by carbon chisels, and all pure snow-white, yet
  unrecognizable in the sublime horror of great darkness.</p>

  <p>It is to the animal and vegetable coral the sea owes its
  arborescent and floriform scenery, the counterpart of the forest and
  phaenogamous beauty that adorns the land. The home of these wonderful
  creatures must be visited to realize the beauty of their dwellings
  and the wonderful structures they produce. A diver who explored the
  serene sea about the Hayti banks gives a beautiful description of the
  splendors of the under-world. The white, chalky bottom is visible
  from the surface at a depth of one hundred feet. Over that brilliant
  floor the filtered sunshine spreads a cloth of gold continually
  flecked with sailing shadows and fluctuating tints. The singular
  clearness of the medium removes that lovely violet drapery which
  surrounds like a pavilion the submarine palace, and allows a wider
  scope of vision. But the scene here is not the play of sunbeams or
  the magic glory of the prismal waters. Form adds its grace to the
  loveliness of color and the play of light and shadow. The structures,
  the work of astraea, madrepores, andreas and meandrinas, bear a
  singular resemblance to fabrications of the architect. One massive
  dome or archway, a hundred feet in diameter, rises to the surface.
  Its front is carved in elaborate tracery and crusted with serpulae,
  looking like the fret-and flower-work that covers Saracenic
  architecture. Looking through this into the violet ambuscade, the eye
  falls upon colonnades, light slender shafts a foot in diameter, that
  seem to <span class="pagenum">[pg 50]</span> support the paly-golden,
  lustrous roof. It is curiously like a vast temple, spreading every
  way in vault and colonnade, on which religious enthusiasm or barbaric
  royalty has worked with a reckless waste of art and labor. Nor is it
  the cold and shapely beauty of the stone: it seems to be a temple
  built of many-colored glass. To understand the magnificence of the
  wonderful structure, the reader must have in mind the laws affecting
  light in transmission through water&#8212;the frangibility of the
  rays, the frequent alternations in dispersion, reflection,
  interference and accidental and complementary color. He must
  recollect that every indentation, every twist of stony serpulae or
  fluting of the zoophyte catches the light and divides and splinters
  it into radiance, burning with a fringe of silver fire or flashing
  steel. When the mind has conceived of that, there is to add the vivid
  beauty of the living coral, its hue of molten colored glass spreading
  a radiant mucus over the stony skeleton.</p>

  <p>But he has not yet entered into an entire conception of its
  loveliness. The arborescent and phaenogamous forms of the coral are
  to be noticed. Here is a plant: it has a pale, gray-blue stalk, and
  all over it are delicate green leaves, fronds or tentacles, as you
  please to call them. There is a fan-shaped shrub whose starry fronds
  recall the <i>Chaemerops serrulata</i> of the adjacent shore. The
  ament, so to speak, of the <i>Parasmilia centralis</i>, the catkin of
  the sea, recalls its terrene counterpart. There are other flowers in
  fascicles and corymbs. The rose is not lacking, but glows with the
  radiant beauty of its petaliferous sister; the columnar trunks of
  stony trees, covered with green, flossy mosses, are scattered about;
  and fresh fountains gush from the rocks, the white water as clearly
  distinguishable from the ultramarine as in the upper
  atmosphere.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
  "#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

  <p>But some varieties of beauty in the coral belong to calmer seas:
  among others, the Red Sea is noticed for the exquisite loveliness of
  its coralline formations. An American explorer, well known in
  submarine diving, once visited that gulf sacred in history, and for a
  purpose certainly as singular as anything he found there. It was, to
  use his own words, &quot;to fish for Pharaoh&#39;s golden
  chariot-wheels,&quot; lost in that famous pursuit. Is it possible, in
  the nature of things, for such an expedition to be made by any but an
  American? It takes a strong Bible faith, allied to a simple but
  strong self-confidence, to start a man on such an adventure. The
  curious transforming magic of the sea had its effect on the Arab
  dragoman he had engaged to assist him. Having settled on the exact
  spot, the swart Arabian descended, but signaled to return almost
  immediately, and was brought to the surface in open-eyed wonder. With
  all the hyperbole of Oriental imagination he swore positively to the
  finding of the chariot-wheels, and added the jewelry of Pharaoh&#39;s
  household. He was so earnest and so exact in the matter of the golden
  wheel, set with precious stones, that, though the captain dryly asked
  if he did not meet King Pharaoh himself, taking a moist throne and
  keeping court with the fishes, he none the less had the line attached
  and drew up&#8212;the rude wheel of a Tartar wagon, transformed under
  water, but plain and ugly enough above.</p>

  <p>&quot;The djin did it,&quot; explained the Arab. &quot;It is a
  palace of the djins, howadji.&quot;</p>

  <p>Though the adventurous explorer failed in his design on the
  defunct Egyptian, he was rewarded by some compensating views and
  discoveries. He saw there the <i>Xenia elongata</i>, a shrub-like
  coral distinguished for the beauty of its colors, having stellar
  tentacles, rose-colored, blue and lilac, an inch in diameter, and
  looking like flowers of living jewelry; another with a long cue, like
  a tress of hair, and others of allied beauty.</p>

  <p>The coral-stone is seen and admired on centre-tables and in
  jewelry, but this is really the least pleasing beauty in the
  organism. The animal, subjected to exposure, <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 51]</span> is a brown mucus that dissipates in the sun
  and air, but clothed in its native element this glutinous substance
  is instinct with radiant life, the bodies being rose-color and the
  arms a pure white. Sometimes they grow in clusters and corymbs,
  gleaming with a pure, translucent color that fluctuates and changes
  in the light</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i10">Like colors of a shell,</p>

    <p class="i2">That keep the hue and polish of the wave.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Our searcher found one unexpected verification of the story in
  Exodus. The passage in the Bible does not leave altogether in mystery
  the natural means by which the transit was effected. We are told of
  the strong east wind and the wall of waters. At the point near Suez a
  shoal extends quite across the sea. For several days this wind had
  borne back the shallow waters, descending as it did from the rugged
  mountain-slopes, and opening or sweeping back the deep as it were.
  Then the tide came, thrust forward in accumulated volume, until it
  made a real wall of waters that stood up in a huge crested, angry
  foam. It was sufficiently like to cause the explorer to apprehend the
  possibility of finding Pharaoh by traveling the same watery road.
  Another question that has puzzled scholars found a solution in the
  American&#39;s observation. Smith&#39;s <i>Bible Dictionary</i>
  discusses learnedly the name of this curious gulf, written [Greek: ae
  eruthra thalassa] in the Septuagint. The <i>Dictionary</i> surmises
  that the name was derived from the red western mountains, red coral
  zoophytes, etc., and appears to give little weight to the real and
  natural reason which came under our American&#39;s notice. On one
  occasion the diver observed, while under sea, that the curious
  wavering shadows, which cross the lustrous golden floor like
  Frauenhofer&#39;s lines on the spectrum, began to change and lose
  themselves. A purple glory of intermingled colors darkened the violet
  curtains of the sea-chambers, reddening all glints and tinges with an
  angry fire. Instead of that lustrous, golden firmament, the
  thallassphere darkened to crimson and opal. The walls grew purple,
  the floor as red as blood: the deep itself was purpled with the
  venous hue of deoxidized life-currents.</p>

  <p>The view on the surface was even more magnificent. The sea at
  first assumed the light tawny or yellowish red of sherry wine. Anon
  this wine-color grew instinct with richer radiance: as far as eye
  could see, and flashing in the crystalline splendor of the Arabian
  sun, was a glorious sea of rose. The dusky red sandstone hills, with
  a border of white sand and green and flowered foliage, like an
  elaborately wrought cup of Bohemian glass enameled with brilliant
  flowers, held the sparkling liquid petals of that rosy sea. The
  surface, on examination, proved to be covered with a thin brickdust
  layer of infusoriae slightly tinged with orange. Placed in a white
  glass bottle, this changed to a deep violet, but the wide surface of
  the external sea was of that magnificent and brilliant rose-color. It
  was a new and pleasing example of the lustrous, ever-varying beauty
  of the ocean world. It was caused by diatomaceae, minute algae, which
  under the microscope revealed delicate threads gathered in tiny
  bundles, and containing rings, like blood-disks, of that curious
  coloring-matter in tiny tubes.</p>

  <p>This miracle of beauty is not without its analogies in other seas.
  The medusae of the Arctic seas, an allied existence, people the
  ultramarine blue of the cold, pure sea with vivid patches of living
  green thirty miles in diameter. These minute organisms are doubly
  curious from their power of astonishing reproduction and the strange
  electric fire they display. Minute as these microscopic creatures
  are, every motion and flash is the result of volition, and not a mere
  chemic or mechanic phosphorescence. The <i>Photocaris</i> lights a
  flashing cirrus, on being irritated, in brilliant kindling sparks,
  increasing in intensity until the whole organism is illuminated. The
  living fire washes over its back, and pencils in greenish-yellow
  light its microscopic outline. Nor do these little creatures lack a
  beauty of their own. Their minute shields of pure translucent silex
  are elaborately wrought in <span class="pagenum">[pg 52]</span>
  microscopic symbols of mimic heraldry. They are the chivalry of the
  deep, the tiny knights with lance and cuirass, and oval bossy shield
  carved in quaint conceits and ornamental fashion. Nor must we despise
  them when we reflect upon their power of accretion. The
  <i>Gallionellae</i>, invisible to the naked eye, can, of their
  heraldic shields and flinty armor, make two cubic feet of Bilin
  polishing slate in four days. By straining sea-water, a web of
  greenish cloth of gold, illuminated by their play of self-generated
  electric light, has been collected. Humboldt and Ehrenberg speak of
  their voracity, their power of discharging electricity at will, and
  their sporting about, exhibiting an intelligent enjoyment of the life
  God has given to them. Man and his works perish, but the monuments of
  the infusoriae are the flinty ribs of the sea, the giant bones of
  huge continents, heaped into mountain-ranges over which the granite
  and porphyry have set their stony seal for ever. Man thrives in his
  little zone: the populous infusoriae crowd every nook of earth from
  the remote poles to the burning equatorial belt.</p>

  <p>As the coral, in its soft, milky chalk, gives a name to tropical
  seas, so also it is a question to my simplicity if the Yellow Sea,
  Black Sea and White Sea do not owe their color and name, in part at
  least, to microscopic infusoriae. One of these, the Yellow Sea, is
  very similar in many characteristics to our beautiful southern gulf,
  and there is connected with it an incident or two illustrative of
  submarine adventure which is the partial purpose of this desultory
  sketch.</p>

  <p>About the time our American was investing in Pharaoh&#39;s golden
  chariot-wheels an East Indiaman was trading its way from the English
  docks, eighteen weary weeks&#39; sail by seamen&#39;s law, and more
  tedious by delays. They exchanged for bullion on the Gold Coast; for
  bullion and bad Cape brandy at Good Hope to sell to the Mohammedans,
  who are forbidden to drink it. At Bombay and Calcutta they exchanged
  bullion and brandy for opium to sell to the Chinese, who are
  forbidden to buy or use it. Whether the coolie trade was included in
  its iniquities or not, I cannot say. Very possibly that was the
  return cargo. From Ceylon they proceed to Siam, and thence to
  Hong-Kong, where they drop anchor in the offing, and by a special
  custom the cargo is sold and paid for in sycee silver before
  disfreighting, and the bullion is in the safe of the huge smuggler,
  although the opium has not yet been removed. The Chinese restrictive
  laws are very severe; but when we note that ninety thousand gallons
  of confiscated whisky were seized in godly Massachusetts in one year,
  we can infer the difficulties in the Maine law of the Celestials. The
  custom is for a hong, a smuggler in a Chinese junk, to draw up beside
  the English contrabandist and transfer the cargo in the outer
  harbor.</p>

  <p>It is afternoon, and the great slumbering ocean breathes, but not
  with the quick, palpitating tide of the Atlantic. The smuggler sits
  on the oleaginous sea, tinged to ochreous yellow, waiting for evening
  and the confederate junk. The tropic twilight comes on swift
  red-golden wings that fan the vivid stars to brightness, and the
  rising tide breaks the surface into wrinkles of phosphorescent fire.
  High over head is the wide, unbroken canopy of the Pacific sky, and
  the gush of a larger moon than ours fills all the sphere with
  splendor as the huge ship stirs lazily in its Narcissus poise over
  its own reflection. There is a reddish glow in the western horizon
  over Hong-Kong, a fainter glimmer west by south over Macao, and
  farther west and north the reflected glories of the sacred city of
  Canton. The three make a semicircular crescent, like a great floating
  moon, on the horizon. A coral islet juts out between the cities under
  which the huge smuggler affects to play &quot;I spy&quot;&#8212;only
  affects, for she does not care for the authorities she bribes nor the
  laws she despises.</p>

  <p>But the wind draws up the curtain of cloud by strands of rainy
  cordage, and men aloft are loosing the reefed topsail, bracing the
  after-yards and setting them for a run in on the larboard tack. They
  handle gaskets, bunt-lines, leech-lines, <span class="pagenum">[pg
  53]</span> fix her best bib and spencer, like a country girl for a
  run up to town. Men are swarming about the yards and rigging. That is
  not all: Lascars, stevedores, supercargoes, the hong merchants,
  agents, are all busy breaking bulk. The India opium is covered with
  petals of the plant and stowed in chests lined with hides and covered
  with gunny; and these cases are locked in by stays, spars and
  bulkheads to prevent jamming. Helter-skelter and confusion alow and
  aloft, on the yards, rigging, deck, between decks and under hatches.
  The captain and purser are gloating over the sycee silver, for the
  Chinese government is as jealous of its exportation as of the
  importation of opium; and the sky and the sea are dark and angry. In
  a slovenly way the sails are trimmed, and she edges clumsily around
  the point with the bullion and opium, the full freight and gains of a
  year&#39;s voyaging and trading. Half an hour or an hour hence she
  will be free, and the junk dropping down to sea with the drugs in
  her. All at once a shriek or yell of &quot;Hard aport!&quot; and a
  great iron outward-bound steamer from Hong-Kong bursts into the
  unwieldy Chinaman, goes crunching through her like ripping
  pasteboard; tears her open; snarls through steamy nostrils and
  cindery fiery mouth, and growls over her wreck. And the sodden,
  stupefied merchantman, as if drunk with opium, goes yelling and
  staggering with her sleepy drugs to the bottom, and stays there,
  sycee silver and all.</p>

  <p>From pricking his way across the Tartar plains, and probing in the
  Dead Sea and eating its fruits, just to know that living crustaceae
  could be found in one and pulpy flesh in the other, our Launfal,
  looking for the Sangreal in chariot-wheels, wound his devious way to
  the Flowery Kingdom, having tried a stroke or two at pearl-diving,
  and given some valuable hints, that were wasted, in Red Sea fishing
  and the Suez Canal. The sleepy Celestial seasons had gone flowering
  their way to paradise, and the opium-smuggler and her sycee silver
  lay safe and swallowed in ribs and jowl of quicksand. Our American
  proposed to have it up by the locks. Two things said Nay&#8212;the
  coral insect, which was using it in its architectural designs, and
  the hungry quicksand. Worst of all, the American could not find it.
  They hid the bulky vessel in hills of sand, and after two months&#39;
  labor in submarine armor the speculator was beaten. &quot;Get a
  coolie,&quot; said a resident China merchant, and he did.</p>

  <p>Every seaport city of China is a twin. It is two cities&#8212;one
  inland, narrow-streeted, paved with rubble stones; the other at sea,
  floating on bamboo reeds. The amphibious inmates of the marine town
  never go ashore, but are a species of otter or seal. Besides, they
  are first-class thieves, as well as cowardly, cruel pirates and
  wreckers. They will steal the sheathing from a copper-bottomed vessel
  in broad daylight, and at night a guard-boat is necessary for
  protection. They will defy a sentry on shipboard&#8212;steal his ship
  from under him while he is wondering what he is set to guard. They
  are all expert divers, as familiar with the sea-bottom as with their
  own ugly little hovels. Such a native was found, and for a dollar
  spotted the submerged vessel in her matrix of sand and coral.</p>

  <p>&quot;Now set a guard-boat,&quot; said the Englishman, &quot;or he
  will steal the line, to get another dollar for finding the smuggler
  again.&quot;</p>

  <p>But the want of experts defeated the plan, after all. It was
  necessary to use a petard to lay bare the treasure, and no one had
  the necessary skill. When the American consented to lost time and
  defeat the cyclone threw another spoil in his way. The East like the
  West Indies is the brooding-place of storms, which in gyratory coils,
  like a lasso thrown wide and large, go twisting north by west. It
  caught a French frigate in the loop, and flung her poor bones on the
  coral reefs, and the hungry sand absorbed her. It is a peculiarity of
  those seas. But she was found, and the petard, like a huge axe
  wielded by a giant&#39;s arms, cut into her treasure-house and
  rescued it. The American&#39;s expenses for a journey round the world
  were paid.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 54]</span>

  <p>I have heard a sufficiently incredible story of a man submerged in
  a Chinese junk and under water twelve hours, yet taken out alive. A
  Chinese junk is the nightmare of marine architecture. It is owned in
  partnership by a company, but there is this difference from an
  ordinary charter-party. Each man owns his share or allotment of the
  vessel, and it is divided off into actual compartments or boxes made
  water-proof; and each one of these pigeon-holes the hong or merchant
  owns and stocks to suit himself. All open out upon the upper deck,
  and are battened down&#8212;sometimes with a glass skylight if used
  as a chamber. The structure in junk form is the thing&#39;s proper
  registry, since any departure from the ancient model would subject
  her to heavy taxation as an alien vessel.<a id="footnotetag2" name=
  "footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is a very
  effectual mode of preventing any improvement in shipbuilding among
  the Chinese.</p>

  <p>One of these clumsy arks went on the rocks in a typhoon, and was
  covered over her deck, leaving, however, the projecting skylight on
  or near a level with the surface. The hong was in this cuddy-hole,
  frantic between personal loss and personal peril. Suddenly there was
  a jar and a crash, and the sea beat over her. Fortunately, the
  skylight was closed water-tight, but, unfortunately, some of the
  spars and rigging blocked up the exit, even if he had dared the
  venture. The bolts of the sea barred him in.</p>

  <p>But Chinese wreckers and Chinese thieves are on the alert. Wattai,
  or some such queer piratical Celestial with devilish propensities,
  went for the spoil, settling the salvage by arithmetic of his own.
  The wreck was removed from the skylight, and under the water, in that
  dense chamber, stagnant with mephitic air, the bruised, stupefied
  hong was found.</p>

  <p>As is apparent from a previous example, the tendency of the
  sea-sand to absorb and conceal a sunken vessel is one of those
  difficulties that beset the explorer. But for that the recovery of
  treasure would be more frequent, the profession or business more
  lucrative. The number of vessels sunk annually, we learn from
  Lloyd&#39;s statistics, is one hundred thousand tons to the English
  commercial marine; and out of 551 vessels lost to the royal navy, 391
  were sunk. Sir Charles Lyell estimates that there might be collected
  in the sea more evidences of man&#39;s art and industry than exist at
  any one time on the surface of the earth. But while the sea
  preserves, it hides. An example of the kind occurred in the wreck of
  the Golden Gate, a California steamer heavy with bullion. It occurred
  during the war, and the only expert diver within reach was an
  expatriated rebel. He had been a man of fortune, but, venturing too
  rashly in the Confederacy, he lost by confiscation and perhaps
  persecution. However, he was the man for the insurance companies, and
  a treaty was concluded, allowing him sixty per cent. salvage.</p>

  <p>The vessel had gone down in tide water. The persistent sea had
  rocked and rocked it, and washed the tenacious quicksands about it,
  and finally concealed it. The search for it was long and tedious, and
  once given up or nearly given up. But as the disappointed diver was
  preparing to ascend his foot touched something firm, which proved to
  be a part of the wooden frame of the ship.</p>

  <p>But even when found the difficulties had only begun. The
  tenacious, elastic sand defied all tools or leverage: no petard could
  blast so fickle and treacherous a substance. Wit and ingenuity can
  devise where ordinary art or engineering has failed. The diver took a
  lesson from the neighboring gold-miner, whose hydrostatic pump
  chisels away the mountain-side to lay bare the mother quartz. Fitted
  with such an engine, he swept the silted sand from the deck of the
  prize, and dug it out of the elastic matrix after the fashion of
  Macduff&#39;s birth.</p>

  <p>By a great misfortune, incipient jealousies and the eager spirit
  of covetousness now showed themselves. It was at first whispered, and
  then asseverated, that if the bullion was once recovered the rebel
  might whistle for his sixty per cent. salvage. It was a bitter, bad
  time&#8212;a time <span class="pagenum">[pg 55]</span> of mistrust
  and suspicion&#8212;and the plan of defrauding the diver was only too
  feasible. He would be involved in a suit with a wealthy company at a
  time when prejudice, if not the form of law, regarded him as having
  forfeited a citizen&#39;s right. It placed him in a difficult
  position&#8212;more difficult because he could get no safe assurance,
  and was evidently suspected and watched. The diver concluded that his
  only way to secure his sixty per cent. salvage was to take it.</p>

  <p>So it was that, with something of the feelings of the
  resurrectionists, a bold, dark party went to rob the charnel-house of
  the sea, to spoil it of its golden bones and wedgy ingots of silver.
  They chose a mirky night, when the thick air seemed too clotted and
  moist to break into hurly-burly of storm, and yet too heavy and dank
  to throw off the black envelope of fog and cloud. The black,
  oleaginous water seemed to slope from the muffled oar in a gluey,
  shining wave, and the heavy ripple at the bow of their boat parted in
  a long, adhesive roll, sloping away, but not breaking into froth or
  glisten of electric fire. The air and the sea seemed brooding in a
  heavy, hopeless misery, and the strange sense of plundering, not the
  living, but the dead, as if the sunken vessel was a huge coffin, was
  upon them. With that cautious sense of superstitious dread choking
  their muttered whispers, they reached the spot and prepared to
  descend. The task of sinking through that pitchy consistence, into
  the intricacy of that black, coffin-like hold, among the drowned
  corpses, to do a deed of doubtful right, must have intensified the
  horror of great darkness and that sublimity of silence that in the
  under-sea peoples the void shadows with horrible existences and fills
  the concave with voices. But it was done; and with trembling
  eagerness the weighty ingots, the unalloyed bars, were safely
  shipped, loading down the boat. Then louder and louder came the dash
  of oars. For a few moments they felt the way with muffled stroke into
  the shrouding shadows. But practiced ears caught the softened roll in
  the rollocks, and keen eyes marked the shadowy boat in the deepening
  gloom. It must be the skilled oar and adroit steering that saves them
  now, but not far away lie the long shadows of the shelving coast and
  its black-bearded forest. The swing of the oars became bold, open and
  exciting, and angry challenges passed. But the burden of the heavy
  gold fought against them, like the giant&#39;s harp calling Master!
  Master! on the shoulders of flying Jack of the Bean-stalk. The light,
  trim craft of the pursuers edged upon them, and the shadow of an
  angry struggle in the pitchy, reeking night gloomed over them.
  &quot;No, no,&quot; said the leader: &quot;no bloodshed for the
  cursed stuff! Here, give me a lift;&quot; and with a heave and plunge
  the massy rouleaux splashed into the water, and the boat rose lighter
  with an easier conscience. The sea shut close-fisted over its own,
  while the pursuing boat paused and eddied about it, as if held to the
  treasure by invisible, impalpable strands. The pursuit was abandoned,
  and the betrayed or treacherous diver escaped. But busy rumor reports
  that he returned at leisure to the spot, and that the bullion of the
  Golden Gate went to replenish the forfeited fortune of the bold
  ex-rebel. Believe as you like, good reader.</p>

  <p>The sea-sand, in its industrious zeal in covering up memorials of
  man&#39;s art and industry, is often curiously assisted by the
  zoophytes and vegetation of the ocean, as well as guarded in its
  labor by abnormal monsters of piscine creation. An example of this
  occurred in an amusing venture after Lafitte&#39;s gold. While the
  Gulf coast of Western Louisiana is fortified, in its immature
  <i>terre tremblante</i>, by the coral reefs and islets, it has the
  appearance of having been torn into ragged edges by the hydrostatic
  pressure of the Gulf Stream. On one of these little islets or keys,
  hard by Caillon Bay, the rumor went that the buccaneer had sunk a
  Spanish galleon laden with pieces of eight and ingots of despoiled
  Mexico. The people thereabout are a simple, credulous race of Spanish
  Creoles, speaking no English, keeping the saints&#39; days, and
  watching the salt-pans of the more energetic but <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 56]</span> scarcely more thrifty Americans with curious
  wonder. They chanced in their broken tongue to commit the story of
  the treasure to a diver of an equally simple faith, who set about
  putting it to more practical use than to gild an hour with an old
  legend. They told how the spook of the Spanish captain haunted the
  wreck, and that the gold was guarded by a dragon in the shape of a
  monstrous horned and mottled frog, or some other devil of the sea, to
  which the diver did seriously incline, but not to make him give up
  the undertaking. He prudently, however, consulted with an old Indian
  witch, and so received the devil&#39;s good word, and piously got a
  bottle of holy water from the priest, and thus was well fenced in
  above and below.</p>

  <p>But his coadjutors were inexperienced, and perhaps his own courage
  was of that saccharine character that gets oozy and slushy in moist
  perils. When descending with his leaded boots on the dark green
  outline of sea mosses that in the clear Gulf invested the vessel in a
  verdurous coat, by some mistake he was let down with a slip, and went
  hurtling through the rotten planks, losing his holy water and sending
  his witch&#39;s wand&#8212;well, to its original owner. He crushed
  through, and the infinite dust of infusoriae and diatomaceae choked
  his vision. The <i>Teredo navalis</i>, whose labors are so
  destructive in southern seas, had perforated the old hulk, and
  converted the vessel into a spongy mass of wood, clay and lime.
  Innumerable algae and curious fungi of the sea, hydroids,
  delicate-frost formed emerald plumuluria and campanuluna, bryozoa,
  mollusks, barnacles and varieties of coral had used it as a
  builder&#39;s quarry and granary. As the geologist finds atom by atom
  of an organism converted into a stony counterfeit, these busy
  existences had preserved the vessel&#39;s shape, but converted the
  woody fibre to their own uses. He could see nothing at first but a
  mixture of green and ochreous dust, through which tiny electric fires
  went quivering and shaking. In the confusion he lost the signal line,
  and had no way of making his condition known. Plunging about as the
  sea dust began to settle, and already more intent on finding the
  life-line and getting out of that than of securing Lafitte&#39;s
  gold, he observed some spectators not pleasant to look upon. A
  lobster or a crab is much pleasanter upon the table than in the sea,
  and there were other things he knew, and some he believed, might not
  take his hasty visit pleasantly. There was the horseshoe-fish with
  ugly strings hanging from his base, disagreeable arachnides, strange
  star fish and their parasites, and, curiously, a large wolfish fish
  that had built a nest and was watching it and him&#8212;watching him
  with no agreeable or timid expression in its angry eyes. He was just
  expecting Victor Hugo&#39;s devil fish to complete his horror when a
  sudden, sharp, bone-breaking shock struck him from an electrical eel
  or marine torpedo. This was a real and sensible danger, and as he
  struggled to ascend the hulk to the rotten half-deck, the spongy
  substance gave way, the treacherous quicksand, with its smooth,
  tenacious throat-clutch, slid down and caught him. The danger was
  real and imminent, when his companions above, observing the slide,
  drew him up. And that, I believe, was the first and last attempt to
  levv on Lafitte&#39;s gold.</p>

  <p>But the experience of Pharaoh and the danger of our rambling
  wrecker are not the only instances of the wall of waters or the
  destruction it causes. Nine days after a storm in the Gulf, a
  traveler, finding his way from the salt-pans of Western Louisiana,
  took a little fishing-craft. There was that fresh purity in the air
  and the sea which follows the bursting of the elements. The numerous
  &quot;bays&quot; and keys that indent the shore looked fresher and
  brighter, and there was that repentant beauty in Nature which aims to
  soothe us into forgetfulness of its recent angry passions. The
  white-winged sea-birds flew about, and tall water-fowl stood silently
  over their shadows like a picture above and below. The water sparkled
  with salt freshness, and the roving winds sat in the shoulder of the
  sail, resting and riding to port.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg
  57]</span>

  <p>The little bark slipped along the shores and shallows, and in and
  out by key and inlet, seeing its shadow on the pure white sand that
  seemed so near its keel. The last vestige of the storm was gone, and
  the little Gulf-world seemed fresher and gladder for it. The tropical
  green grasses and water-plants hung their long, linear, hairlike
  sheaths in graceful curves, and patches of willow-palm and palmetto,
  in many an intricate curve and involution, made a labyrinth of
  verdure. The wild loveliness of the numerous slips and channels,
  where never a boat seemed to have sailed since the Indian&#39;s
  water-logged canoe was tossed on the shadowy banks, was enhanced by
  the vision of distant ships, their sails even with the water, or
  broken by the white buildings of a sleepy plantation in its bower of
  fig and olive and tall moss-clustered pines.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the traveler fancied he heard a cry, but the fishermen
  said No&#8212;it was the scream of water-fowl or the shrill call of
  an eagle far above dropping down from the blue zenith; and they
  sailed on. Again he heard the distant cry, and was told of the
  panther in the bush and wild birds that drummed and called with
  almost human intonation; and they sailed on again. But again the
  mysterious, troubled cry arose from the labyrinth of green, and the
  traveler entreated them to go in quest of it. The fishers had their
  freight for the market&#8212;delay would deteriorate its value; but
  the anxious traveler bade them put about and he would bear the
  loss.</p>

  <p>It was well they did. There, in the dense coverts of the
  sea-swamps, amid the brackish water-growths and grasses, they found a
  man and woman, ragged, torn, starved. For nine days they had had no
  food but the soft pith of the palmetto, coarse mussels or scant
  poison-berries, their bed the damp morass, and their drink the
  brackish water; and they told the wild and terrible story of Last
  Island.</p>

  <p>Last Island was the Saratoga and Long Branch of the South, the
  southern-most watering-place in the Gulf. Situated on a fertile coral
  island enriched by innumerable flocks of wild-fowl, art had brought
  its wealth of fruit and flower to perfection. The cocoanut-palm,
  date-palm and orange orchards contrasted their rich foliage in the
  sunshine with the pineapple, banana and the rich soft turf of the
  mesquit-grass. The air was fragrant with magnolia and orange bloom,
  the gardens glittering with the burning beauty of tropical flower,
  jessamine thickets and voluptuous grape arbors, the golden wine-like
  sun pouring an intoxicating balm over it; graceful white cottages
  festooned with vines, with curving chalet or Chinese roofs colored
  red; pinnacled arbors and shadowy retreats of espaliers pretty as a
  coral grove; and a fair shining hotel in the midst, with arcades and
  porches and galleries--the very dream of ease and luxury, as delicate
  and trim as if made of cut paper in many forms of prettiness. Here
  was the nabob&#39;s retreat; in this balmy garden of delight all that
  luxury, art and voluptuous desire could hint or hope for was
  collected; and nothing harsh or poor or rugged jarred the fullness of
  its luxurious ease.</p>

  <p>Ten nights before its fragrant atmosphere was broken into
  beautiful ripples by the clang and harmony of dancing music. It was
  the night of the &quot;hop.&quot; The hotel was crowded. Yachts and
  pleasure-vessels pretty as the petals of a flower tossed on the
  water, or as graceful shells banked the shores; and the steamer at
  twilight came breathing short, excited breaths with the last relay,
  for it was the height of the summer season. In their light, airy
  dresses, as the music swam and sung, bright-eyed girls floated in
  graceful waltzes down the voluptuous waves of sound, and the gleam of
  light and color was like a butterflies&#39; ball. The queenly,
  luscious night sank deeper, and lovers strolled in lamp-lighted
  arcades, and dreamed and hoped of life like that, the fairy existence
  of love and peace; and so till, tired of play, sleep and rest came in
  the small hours.</p>

  <p>Hush! All at once came the storm, not, as in northern latitudes,
  with premonitory murmur and fretting, lashing itself by slow degrees
  into white heat and rain, but the storm of the tropics, <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 58]</span> carrying the sea on its broad, angry
  shoulders, till, reaching the verdurous, love-clustered little isle,
  it flung the bulk of waters with all its huge, brawny force right
  upon the cut-paper prettinesses, and broke them into sand and
  splinters. Of all those pretty children with blue and with opalescent
  eyes, arrayed like flowers of the field; of all those lovers dreaming
  of love in summer dalliance, and of cottages among figs and olives;
  of all the vigorous manhood and ripe womanhood, with all the skill
  and courage of successful life in them,&#8212;not a tithe was saved.
  The ghastly maw of the waters covered them and swallowed them. A few
  sprang, among crashing timbers, on a floor laden with impetuous
  water&#8212;the many perhaps never waked at all, or woke to but one
  short prayer. The few who were saved hardly knew how they were
  saved&#8212;the many who died never knew how they were slain or
  drowned.</p>

  <p>It has twice been my fortune in life to see such a storm, and to
  know its sudden destruction: once, to see a low, broad, shelving
  farm-house disappear to the ground timbers before my eyes, as if its
  substance had vanished into air, while great globes of electric fire
  burst down and sunk into the ground; once, to see a pine forest of
  centuries&#39; growth cut down as grass by the mower&#39;s scythe. I
  do not think it possible to see a third and survive, and I do not
  wish my soul to be whirled away in the vortex of such a storm.</p>

  <p>At noon or later, after the ruin of Last Island, a gentleman of a
  name renowned in South-western story found himself clinging to a bush
  in the wild waters, lashed by the long whips of branches, half dead
  with fatigue and fear. For a time the hurly-burly blinded and hid
  everything, and the long roll rocked and tore at him in desperate
  endeavor to wrench loose his bleeding fingers. The impulse of the
  wind and storm at such a time is as of a solid body, and there is a
  look of solidity in the very appearance of the magnificent force. But
  as it abated he thought he heard a faint cry, and looking around he
  saw a poor girl in the ribbons of her night-dress clinging to a
  branch, and slipping from her feeble hold. Tired as he was, and wild
  and dangerous as the attempt might be, he did not dare to leave her
  to perish. Choosing his time in a lull, he struck out to the bush,
  and reached it just as her ebbing strength gave way. He took her in
  his sturdy arms, and, clinging with tooth and nail, stayed them both
  to their strange anchorage. Faint, half conscious, disrobed as she
  was, in the sweet, delicate features, the curve of the lip, and the
  raven tresses clothed in seaweed, he recognized the Creole belle of
  last night&#39;s hop. He cheered and encouraged her, pointing out
  that the storm was abating, had abated. It could not be long until
  search-boats came, and while he had strength to live she should share
  it. It proved true. Generous and hardy fishers and ships had come at
  once to the scene of disaster, and were busy picking up the few
  spared by wind and wave. They found the two clinging together and to
  that slight bush, and took them off, wrapping them in ready, rough
  fishermen&#39;s coats. The reader can see the end of that story. A
  meeting so appointed had its predestined end in a love-match. So we
  leave it and them: the rest of their lives belongs to them, not to
  us.</p>

  <p>The pair found by our fishing-smack were a wealthy planter and his
  wife. For nine days of starvation and danger they had clung together.
  When I think of the husband&#39;s manly care in thus abiding by the
  wife, I find it hard to reconcile it with the fact that he only
  valued his life and hers at a few dollars&#8212;not enough to
  compensate the traveler for the loss incurred as demurrage to the
  fishermen.</p>

  <p>Now Last Island is but a low sandy reef, on which a few straggling
  fruit trees try to keep the remembrance of its bygone beauty. It is
  as bare and desolate as the bones of those who filled its halls in
  the cataclysm of that dreadful night&#8212;bones which now waste to
  whiteness on sterile shores or are wrought into coral in the
  under-sea.</p>

  <h2>POSEY&#39;S NUGGET.</h2>

  <p>When the California &quot;gold fever&quot; broke out in the spring
  of 1849, Doctor Hanchett was living at Clarksville in Southern
  Indiana. Doctor Hanchett, it should be stated, had received his
  professional title not by the favor of any medical college or other
  learned institution, but through the simpler and less formal method
  that obtains among the free and generous people amongst whom his
  lines were cast. The process may be explained in a few words. In the
  fall of 1846 a recruiting station was established at Vicksburg to
  enlist volunteers for the war with Mexico, and Hanchett, at that time
  a resident of Vicksburg, and laboring in a profession&#8212;the
  saltatorial, to wit&#8212;a shade less illustrious than that to which
  he was so soon to attain, was the first man in the city to enlist.
  This momentous circumstance procured for him not only the prompt
  recognition of a patriotic press, which blazoned his name abroad with
  so many eccentricities of spelling that he came near losing his
  identity, but also gave him a claim in courtesy to such a position in
  the organization of his company, within the grasp of the mere high
  private, as he might select. After due deliberation he chose that of
  company commissary&#8212;an office unknown, I think, to the <i>United
  States Army Regulations</i>, but none the less familiar to our
  volunteer service. To this post he was promptly appointed by his
  captain; and, thus placed in the line of promotion, he rose rapidly
  till he attained the rank of hospital steward. The thing was done.
  Hanchett was Doctor Hanchett from that day, and the title was very
  much the larger part of the man ever after. How he had lived for
  forty years or more without it is still a mystery.</p>

  <p>When the war was over, Doctor Hanchett stranded upon the northern
  bank of the Ohio, in the State of Indiana. As a returning brave he
  was, naturally, quite warmly received. As a veteran not unwilling to
  recount his adventures by flood and field, he speedily became famous
  as the hero of many deeds of valor and of blood. He had been
  assistant surgeon of his regiment, it appeared, but nevertheless had
  fought in the ranks in every important engagement of the war from
  Monterey to Churubusco, and the number of men who had fallen by his
  own hand from first to last he could not undertake to estimate.
  Though traces of a somewhat lively imagination might be detected in
  most of the doctor&#39;s stories, there is really no good reason to
  doubt that he spoke the simple truth when he averred that with his
  red right hand he had mowed down men like grass, for he actually
  retained the position of hospital steward throughout the whole term
  of his service.</p>

  <p>Finding himself after the lapse of a few weeks not without honor
  in this Indiana town, he struck out suddenly one day a brilliant
  idea: he would devote his remaining years to the practice of the
  profession into which Fortune had so kindly inducted him. He hired a
  house, hung out his banner, and wrote to his wife and daughter, who
  had remained at Vicksburg, to come on immediately to his new home, as
  his fortune was now made.</p>

  <p>Hanchett had married, at an early stage in his original career,
  the only daughter of a bankrupt Vicksburg storekeeper. This young
  woman, who had doubtless found ample opportunity for the practice of
  domestic economy in the paternal home, soon proved herself to be a
  most excellent housekeeper on her own account. She was a jewel indeed
  to her improvident husband, who, finding that she made shift by one
  means or another to keep the family larder supplied, whether he kept
  her purse supplied or not, dismissed a great care from his mind at
  once and for ever, and thenceforth to the end of his days never
  exerted himself beyond his natural bent. <span class="pagenum">[pg
  60]</span> As the daughter, Dora Hanchett, grew to womanhood, she
  divided her mother&#39;s burden with her, and ultimately, as the
  mother&#39;s health failed, relieved her of it almost entirely.</p>

  <p>The family once reunited and domiciled in their new home, it soon
  became evident to the most casual observer that Dora exercised the
  functions of commander-in-chief of that force, and that the doctor,
  notwithstanding his brilliant record in the field, had been
  incontinently reduced to the ranks, and subjected to a rather rigid
  discipline. Let it not be inferred, however, that Dora ruled with a
  high hand or with a rod of iron. Far from it. She was the quietest
  and meekest of tyrants, controlling not by conscious will or effort,
  but by divine commission, as many a woman does.</p>

  <p>Not only was Dora the head of the household in the sense of
  directing its internal affairs, but she likewise soon proved herself
  to be its mainstay as bread-winner. The doctor under her hands became
  a dignified and not unornamental figure-head to the concern, in whom
  she took a certain filial pride. His banner was still allowed to hang
  upon the outer wall, and, as some slight justification of the legend
  borne upon it, the semblance of an office was maintained for him,
  where he spent many solitary and irksome hours daily in the semblance
  of professional study and work. But his income did not amount even to
  a semblance, and upon Dora, therefore, devolved the task of
  maintaining the cuisine as well as the character of the
  establishment. She had been accustomed to this duty indeed ever
  since, upon becoming a schoolteacher at the age of sixteen, she had
  proved her capacity to perform it. She early found her place in the
  public schools of Clarksville, and so the pot was soon boiling
  merrily, and the demands of the doctor&#39;s magnificent appetite
  were duly honored at sight.</p>

  <p>Thus, Doctor Hanchett was enabled to live a life of elegant
  leisure, devoid of care and fruitful of enjoyment to a man of his
  temperament, for some fourteen months. Then he was suddenly smitten
  with the &quot;gold fever,&quot; and went raging through the town,
  seeking whom he might infect. It was one of the curiosities of this
  singular epidemic that it claimed not only those youthful and
  adventurous spirits who were by common consent held to be its
  legitimate victims, but carried off also old and infirm men, chronic
  invalids, and, stranger still, such shiftless, incompetent and
  altogether worthless cumberers of the ground as this Doctor Hanchett;
  thus proving itself to be, like most other contagions, a not entirely
  unmixed evil.</p>

  <p>Not wholly through the efforts of Doctor Hanchett, it is safe to
  say, but in due process of time and events, a company was mustered in
  Clarksville to go overland to California, as so many other companies
  were mustered in hundreds of other towns all over the country in that
  memorable spring of &#39;49. This company, composed principally of
  men from the surrounding country, and containing only two or three
  residents of the village proper, regarded itself as peculiarly
  fortunate in being able to count among its members a gentleman like
  Doctor Hanchett, who, besides being a physician, was an old
  campaigner, and thus likely to prove doubly desirable as a comrade in
  an expedition like that upon which they were embarked.</p>

  <p>It being definitely settled that the doctor was to march with his
  company upon a certain day not far distant, it devolved upon his
  chancellor of the exchequer to provide the sinews of war. Whether
  Dora found this duty an agreeable one or not, she performed it
  promptly and cheerfully. The little hoard that by the sharpest
  economy the frugal girl had contrived to save from her earnings was
  placed in the doctor&#39;s hands without reserve, to be appropriated,
  first to the purchase of an outfit, and next to the defrayment of the
  general expenses of the campaign.</p>

  <p>Proverbially careful and judicious in the expenditure of money, as
  may be supposed, in the purchase of his supplies on this occasion
  Doctor Hanchett quite outshone himself. Besides the indispensable
  pans and shovels and picks <span class="pagenum">[pg 61]</span> with
  which every man provided himself, Doctor Hanchett laid in an
  assortment of miscellaneous drugs and surgical instruments, that
  added a new lustre to his distinction in the eyes of his comrades.
  But it was in the compilation of his wardrobe and his deadly weapons
  that he displayed an individuality of taste altogether unique. It
  being now the month of May, and the journey across the Plains being
  expected to occupy about three months, the doctor, who was a small
  man, bought first a great&#8212;uncommonly great&#8212;coat, that
  fitted him about as snugly as a sentry-box might have done; secondly,
  a pair of cavalry boots, the tops of which towered almost to his
  eyebrows; and thirdly, a silk hat of the very finest and very tallest
  description to be found in the market. Then he purchased a pair of
  large Colt&#39;s revolvers, handsomely mounted in silver, and had his
  name engraved on the plate in bold letters&#8212;&quot;ELIAS
  HANCHETT, M.D.;&quot; and his armory was completed by the addition of
  numerous and various knives of vast length and breadth of blade, into
  the hasp of each of which was let a neat silver plate, upon which was
  engraved his name&#8212;&quot;ELIAS HANCHETT, M.D.&quot; Thus clad
  and thus arsenaled, he bore down upon Dora with much elation as she
  was returning home from her school, and proudly challenged her
  admiration. Of course the loving girl responded heartily,
  notwithstanding her thrifty and methodical soul was racked to see
  such few of her hardly-earned coins as remained unexpended falling to
  the ground and rolling away in all directions as the doctor turned
  pocket after pocket inside out in search of yet another and another
  knife to surprise her withal.</p>

  <p>At last the company got off, going by river to Council Bluffs, and
  thence striking out upon the almost interminable trail, that, however
  surely it might lead to fortune, was far from being a royal road
  thereto. It was two months later when a member of the party,
  compelled by ill-health to abandon the tedious journey and return
  home, brought to Clarksville the first intelligence of the
  achievements of Doctor Hanchett in the capacity of a physician and
  surgeon in actual practice. These achievements cannot be recorded
  here, but a single incident may be mentioned as indicating the
  estimation in which the doctor&#39;s skill speedily came to be held
  by his companions. Before the expedition had been three weeks upon
  the march his surviving comrades, taking alarm at the rapidly
  augmenting number of lonely graves with which they were dotting the
  dreary trail, hastily formed a conspiracy to despoil him of his
  enginery of death. Under the silent stars, what time the doctor was
  sleeping the deep sleep of the overworked practitioner, his
  medicine-case and his miscellaneous assortment of cutlery were
  quietly spirited away, and were never seen again. The doctor
  proclaimed his loss upon waking in the morning, and felt it keenly.
  He declared, however, that he deplored the casualty chiefly in the
  interest of his companions, who were thus deprived, at one fell blow,
  of his further services; and he cursed very heartily, in the same
  interest, the &quot;dastardly red-skins,&quot; whom he assumed to be
  guilty of the theft.</p>

  <p>Dora and her mother waited long and anxiously for a letter from
  the doctor&#39;s own hand, and after many months it came. It was
  dated from &quot;the Heart of the Gold Region,&quot; and, after
  asking them to join him in due ascriptions of thanks to the Almighty
  Powers for his deliverance from many perils and his safe arrival in
  the promised land, and after passing lightly over the invaluable
  services he had been able to render to his companions in his
  professional capacity&#8212;it was not for a modest man to dwell upon
  these&#8212;the doctor proceeded to state frankly that his success in
  the gold fields had far exceeded his most sanguine hopes; that,
  indeed, he might even then call himself an opulent man, inasmuch as
  nothing but the necessary papers were wanting to confirm him in the
  possession of a half interest in the Big Grizzly Claim&#8212;a claim
  that promised an enormously rich yield as soon as arrangements could
  be perfected for developing it. He advised his daughter <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 62]</span> to give up her school at once, and to begin
  to prepare herself for that happy change in her circumstances which
  was now so near at hand; and he closed by requesting her to send him
  by return of mail fifty dollars, and more if she could possibly spare
  more, as he urgently required a little money for &quot;present
  needs.&quot;</p>

  <p>Is it necessary to say how this clear-headed and conscientious
  girl acted upon reading this transparent balderdash? She knew, as
  well as you and I know, that the whole thing was a clumsy game of her
  worthy sire to deplete once more the little hoard that had been
  slowly growing during his absence. She knew that her mother, who had
  worn her life out trying to support an ornamental husband, was fast
  failing in health, and might very soon require such attendance as
  nothing but money could procure. And of course she went directly to
  the bank, drew out her entire deposit, and sped it on its way to
  Elias Hanchett, M.D., before the sun went down.</p>

  <p>It was nearly a year after the arrival of his first letter when
  another epistle was received from the absent doctor. Bad news this
  time&#8212;the worst of bad news. He had been stricken down by a
  terrible malady at a most critical moment in his affairs, and the
  consequence was that his interests had suffered irretrievably. He
  might call himself, in short, a ruined man. He felt that his distress
  of mind, together with the physical anguish of his disease, was more
  than he could bear up against for many hours longer. It was hard for
  an old man to die thus among strangers, far from his own hearthstone
  and the gentle influences that clustered round it. But he should be
  consoled in his last hour by the reflection that he had always
  maintained his family liberally, and had tried to be a kind and
  indulgent husband and father; and he hoped that his daughter, thus
  left alone in the world without any earthly protector, would not
  wholly despair, but would strive for his sake to bear up against
  adversity, and prove herself worthy of the father who had lost his
  life in trying to serve her in his old age. And so farewell! His eyes
  were now about to close for the last time upon the scenes of this
  earth. Signed ELIAS HANCHETT, M.D., with the customary flourish
  beneath the name, as bravely executed as if the writer might have
  twenty years of life ahead of him yet. But stay! P.S. Would not his
  dear daughter, for whom he had sacrificed so much, grant him one last
  little favor? He had not means enough left out of the sad wreck of
  his fortune to procure him decent burial. Would she not send him a
  small sum for that purpose? She might direct it to his own address,
  for if he were gone it would be received by a friend, who would apply
  it faithfully according to the directions he should leave. &quot;And
  now again farewell! And may we meet above!&quot; Signed ELIAS
  HANCHETT, M.D. Flourish as usual.</p>

  <p>I do not believe that Dora Hanchett&#39;s honest estimate of this
  letter was very far different from our own. I am persuaded that she
  was mentally incapable of being seriously deceived by it. But the
  heart of woman is the mystery of the universe. In the face of her
  honest judgment, in the truth of that clear common sense that
  constituted the strongest trait in her character, this absurd girl
  went about bemoaning in dead earnest and in the bitterest grief the
  death of her father. This lasted a week; by which time she had
  succeeded in convincing her mother, at least, that the affliction was
  a real one; and that good lady, being finally, as she believed,
  released from her responsibility, and having no occasion to live
  longer, quietly and peacefully passed away. And Dora, by the light of
  this actual sorrow, came after a while to acknowledge to herself that
  she had been breaking her heart over a fictitious one.</p>

  <p>Of course the money had gone on before this time, and she was far
  from wishing to recall it now. If her father was alive, he was
  welcome to it, she said, for he could not possibly put it to a worse
  use than that to which it had been dedicated.</p>

  <p>A girl as good as Dora could not be <span class="pagenum">[pg
  63]</span> left friendless, whatever domestic affliction she might
  suffer; and so with all her trouble she had no opportunity to become
  absorbed in her sorrow. It would have pained her unspeakably if she
  had been aware that her friends generally, however, so far from
  inclining to grieve with her grief at the possibility of her
  father&#39;s death, were quite unanimous in the view that such a
  dispensation would be &quot;the best thing for Dory that ever turned
  up.&quot; For her part, she could not, after all, rid her mind of the
  apprehension that her father might possibly have been in as serious
  extremity as his letter represented. And if so, and she neglected to
  do her utmost to succor him in his need, what peace could she ever
  find in this world again? In this way she dwelt upon the subject,
  until at last she convinced herself that her whole duty lay in
  nothing less than an immediate effort to go to him. If, fortunately,
  she should find him alive and well, she would gladly share his
  fortune, however hard it might be, and would never leave him so long
  as he lived. But if, as she feared, he should prove to be indeed sick
  and near his end in that wild region, where, she asked, should his
  daughter be but at his side?</p>

  <p>This is the ridiculous way in which such headstrong creatures as
  this Dora Hanchett are accustomed to meet you when you seek to point
  out to them the unreasonableness of a line of conduct on which they
  have set their hearts.</p>

  <p>Deaf to all arguments, therefore, Dora shut up her house and set
  about making preparations for her journey. In the adjoining county,
  as she had learned, a company of gold-hunters had been organized, and
  was then on the point of starting for the Sacramento Valley, in which
  was situated the little town from which her father had last written.
  Of this company of sixty men she knew but one, and he was a mere boy
  in years, the youngest of the party. This was Hiram Bridge,
  familiarly termed Posey in honor of his native county, who four years
  before had been one of Dora&#39;s first pupils in her Clarksville
  school. She was little more than a girl herself at that time, and
  Hiram was her biggest boy; and her recollection now of the bond of
  good-fellowship that soon grew up between herself and the shy,
  overgrown but not overbright lad relieved her of any hesitation she
  might otherwise have felt in applying to him to obtain permission for
  her to accompany his party to its destination.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, you can go, Miss Hanchett,&quot; Posey quietly replied
  to her appeal.</p>

  <p>&quot;But will the rest of the men be willing?&quot; she
  suggested.</p>

  <p>&quot;Doesn&#39;t signify,&quot; said Posey.</p>

  <p>She did prevail on him, however, as a matter of form, to mention
  the subject to his comrades; but as he never took the trouble to
  report to her what action, if any, they took in the matter, she
  started at last, relying altogether on his single friendship for
  protection. That was no mean reliance, though, as she soon began to
  realize. He was an immense fellow, six feet two in height, and broad
  in proportion; and he soon proved to Dora that, however readily he
  had undertaken her safe conduct, he did not lightly esteem that
  charge, but was determined to aid and befriend her in every way
  possible. Thus at the outset she found herself relieved of much of
  the embarrassment and annoyance she had believed to be inseparable
  from such a journey in such companionship. Posey himself she did not
  find to be companionable in the ordinary sense of that word,
  notwithstanding his constant kindness. He was of a quiet turn,
  reserved; of speech, rather forbidding of countenance, and did not
  wear his excellent heart upon his sleeve. There were few surface
  indications of the gold that was in him. Dora was not long, however,
  in finding the auriferous vein; and, to drop metaphor, she soon
  became conscious of a very warm sentiment of gratitude growing up in
  her heart toward her uncouth guide, philosopher and friend.</p>

  <p>Posey&#39;s outfit consisted of a pair of powerful mules and a
  covered wagon, with the usual mining and cooking utensils, and the
  provisions necessary for the journey. In the forward part of this
  wagon, while the expedition was on the <span class="pagenum">[pg
  64]</span> march, Dora sat enthroned; and in its dusky recesses she
  made her couch at night. Not only did the loyal Posey devote himself
  to her guardianship by day, but he kept watch and ward by night,
  sitting bolt upright within a couple of yards of his precious charge
  until the stars grew pale in the dawn. Then, if opportunity offered,
  he would snatch a surreptitious nap, still disdaining to lie down,
  however; and it frequently occurred that the earlier risers in the
  camp would discover Posey sitting on the ground, embracing his nether
  limbs with his long arms, while his head, with its close-cut, sandy
  hair, sank slumberous between his towering knees, like the sun going
  down between two mountain-peaks. To such a length did he carry these
  romantic vigils that he shortly came to look as gaunt and hollow-eyed
  as Famine. In addition to which he had to endure no end of raillery
  from his not too considerate or fastidious companions, who, so far
  from inclining to harm a hair of Dora&#39;s head, were generally
  wholly indifferent to her presence, and could not enter into
  Posey&#39;s solicitude on her behalf.</p>

  <p>Just here, also, Jake Savage, who had spent a year in the mines
  and was piloting the present expedition, was reminded of a story,
  which he obligingly related to Posey, apropos.</p>

  <p>&quot;You see, Posey,&quot; said Jake, &quot;me and
  Hooker&#8212;Hooker was my chum&#8212;had been scratchin&#39; and
  washin&#39; for about seven or eight dollars a day down there to
  McCracken&#39;s Bend, till we got disgusted, and we made up our minds
  that if we couldn&#39;t make more&#39;n that we might as well give up
  and strike for the States. But just then who should come along but
  little Bill Skinner, bound all so fast for up the gulch? Bill had
  been prospectin&#39; around all summer on his own hook, but
  hadn&#39;t struck nothin&#39; yet, and was so much worse off than we
  was that Hooker and me concluded to stay by a while longer. A day or
  two afore, we found out, little Bill had run across a Digger
  somewhere that had told him&#8212;the Lord knows how, for I never see
  a Digger that, could talk English more&#39;n a mule,&#8212;but this
  Digger told little Bill that up the gulch there was rich
  diggin&#39;s. And so Bill was on the rampage to get there. Of course
  me and Hooker we didn&#39;t take no stock in that yarn, and little
  Bill went off alone.</p>

  <p>&quot;A couple of months after that me and Hooker see we&#39;d got
  to do something pretty quick or starve, and so we made up our minds
  to prospect a little. We headed up the gulch, but without ever
  thinkin&#39; of little Bill, and as indications was good, we kept on
  in the same direction for a couple of days. It was on the third day
  out, and we&#39;d got about twenty miles from the Bend, and
  hadn&#39;t struck nothin&#39; yet to bet on, when all of a sudden
  Hooker yells out, &#39;Holy Moses, Jake! look-a there!&#39; and what
  do you s&#39;pose we see?</p>

  <p>&quot;About as fur as from here to that mule there, leanin&#39;
  ag&#39;in a tree, sot little Bill Skinner&#8212;what was left of him,
  I mean, for he was as dead as a dornick. And what do you s&#39;pose
  he was a-settin&#39; on? A nugget of the pure metal worth forty
  thousand dollars! Yes, sir! We could see in a minute how it was. Bill
  had found this nugget, and bein&#39; weak for want of grub, of course
  he couldn&#39;t carry it. So he had sot down on it to guard it. And
  there he sot and sot. He dassent go to sleep for fear somebody&#39;d
  hook it, and he couldn&#39;t leave it to get any grub for the same
  reason. We could see he&#39;d browsed &#39;round on the bushes as fur
  as he could reach, but that couldn&#39;t keep him alive long, and so
  there he&#39;d sot and sot till finally he&#39;d pegged out.</p>

  <p>&quot;And that&#39;s what&#39;s the matter with Posey. I wakes up
  in the night and sees him a-settin&#39; thar by that wagon, and says
  I to myself, &#39;Thar sets Posey on his nugget!&#39; And one of
  these fine mornin&#39;s we&#39;ll find nothin&#39; but Posey&#39;s
  bones a-settin&#39; there, and his buttons and such like.&quot;</p>

  <p>About this time, as they were now nearing the region where danger
  from Indian raids was apprehended, Savage&#39;s company and another
  party hailing from Illinois joined forces for mutual protection, and
  all proceeded thenceforward <span class="pagenum">[pg 65]</span>
  under Savage&#39;s direction. Accompanying this Illinois party was a
  woman going out to the diggings to join her husband, who was
  prospering, and had sent for her to come on. The two women thereafter
  keeping constantly together, Posey felt his responsibility so far
  lightened that he occasionally indulged himself in a
  &quot;square&quot; night&#39;s sleep, while Dora and her new-found
  friend slumbered beneath his ample wagon-cover.</p>

  <p>His partial separation from Dora, occasioned by the advent of this
  other woman on the scene, soon opened Posey&#39;s eyes to the fact
  that a total separation from her would take the ground entirely from
  under his feet, and leave him in a condition that he felt disinclined
  to contemplate so long as there might be a chance to avert such a
  calamity. He accordingly improved the first opportunity that offered,
  and cast himself at the feet of Dora&#8212;literally, mind you, on
  the lee side of a sage bush&#8212;and lisped his love. On this sacred
  ground let us tread as lightly as may be. Suffice it that Posey&#39;s
  suit prospered, and that presently a little programme came to be
  agreed upon between the contracting parties to this effect: They
  would go on for the present precisely as if nothing had
  happened&#8212;Dora to seek her father and Posey to seek his fortune.
  As soon, however, as Dora should have succeeded in restoring the
  doctor to health, or had haply buried him, Posey should be notified,
  and they would thereupon be married. Then Dora would open a school
  somewhere, wherever she might chance to find the indispensable
  children, while Posey, accompanied by his newly-fledged
  father-in-law, if perchance that worthy individual should be spared,
  would launch into the mines and conquer Fortune at the point of the
  pick.</p>

  <p>Time flew fast with the lovers after this, and they were quite
  startled one day when Savage informed them that they were upon the
  very borders of the promised land.</p>

  <p>That evening, an hour before sunset, the train was halted for the
  night at a point whence the travel-worn adventurers could look down
  for the first time into the Sacramento Valley, and render thanks in
  their various ways that the end of their tedious pilgrimage was
  almost reached. As Dora Hanchett and Posey stood together upon a
  green knoll, following with their eyes the winding trail that their
  feet were to descend on the morrow, they descried, toiling slowly
  toward them, one of those returning bands of unsuccessful and
  discouraged veterans&#8212;the reflux of the great wave of
  immigration constantly pouring into the golden valley&#8212;which
  they had frequently met in the course of their long journey. As the
  cavalcade drew nearer, Dora&#39;s attention fixed itself upon a
  curious figure that brought up the rear. Mounted upon a loose
  aggregation of bones and ears that purported to be a mule, this
  mysterious figure gradually approached, while Dora watched it as if
  fascinated. On and on it came, and still she gazed, spell-bound.
  Opposite her it paused. There was no longer any doubt: it was He.
  Clad in the mangled remains of the original great-coat, the original
  boot-tops yet towering in the region of his ears, and the upper half
  of the original beaver crowning his well-developed brain, there He
  was. Slowly and carefully he descended from the back of his shambling
  steed, settled himself well in his boots, pulled up the collar of his
  great-coat&#8212;and there was little but collar left of
  it&#8212;tipped the curtailed and weatherbeaten stovepipe to the
  proper angle, opened his paternal arms and feebly embraced his
  daughter. He announced himself to all concerned as a broken
  man&#8212;a poor unfortunate going home to die, where his bones might
  rest with those of his ancestors, and where his humble name and his
  honorable record in the service of his country would be cherished by
  his fellow-citizens after he should be gone. Providence had surely,
  in his extremity, drawn his daughter to his succor. Now he was
  relieved of all anxiety, and might turn his mind to things above. His
  daughter would fan the spark of life, and keep it burning, God
  willing, till the old home should be reached. Then he would release
  her from her labor of love. Then he would <span class="pagenum">[pg
  66]</span> be at peace with all the world, and would cheerfully die
  in the midst of his weeping friends. He had up to this hour been
  haunted with the apprehension that his poor old frame might be left
  to moulder somewhere in the wide, inhospitable desert that stretched
  between him and his roof-tree. Now that dreadful apprehension was
  banished. The Lord had remembered his own. Dora would walk beside his
  beast and protect him, and the knowledge that she had thus been
  instrumental in prolonging her father&#39;s life would be her
  exceeding great reward.</p>

  <p>A most enchanting prospect for Dora, was it not? Even she did not
  put her neck under the yoke until she had first informed her father
  of her momentous secret, and invited him to assume his rôle in the
  programme already mentioned as arranged by her lover and herself.
  But, as a matter of course, he scorned the suggestion. Posey begged
  and raved, but without avail. The girl never had a question in her
  mind as to her duty from the moment she saw her father approaching.
  She must do as he said&#8212;go back with him as his slave. There was
  no help for it.</p>

  <p>And so the lovers held a hurried consultation, pledged eternal
  fidelity and all that, agreed that Posey should go on and make his
  fortune, and that when Dora should be released by death from her duty
  to her father he should either come back for her or she should go to
  him, and then they would be married. Meantime, he engaged to write to
  her frequently, and she promised to write to him faithfully once
  every week. And then farewell!</p>

  <p>By this time the doctor&#39;s party had left him far behind, and
  naturally, considering the capabilities of his steed, he was growing
  impatient to move on. The early stars were already coming out, and he
  testily reminded Dora, as she lingered over her leavetaking, that
  there was no more time to lose. And so, without a murmur, the devoted
  soul turned her back upon all her new-born hope and joy, and
  dutifully took up the long and dreadful homeward march on foot. And
  Posey, his heart in his mouth and his tongue charged with unutterable
  execrations, gazed gloomily down into the darkening valley, that half
  an hour before had been filled with a radiance &quot;that never shone
  on land or sea.&quot; And as he gazed all the bad in him persistently
  rose up to curse the despicable author of his woe, while all the good
  in him&#8212;about an even balance&#8212;rose up to bless the
  fast-disappearing idol of his heart.</p>

  <p>Slowly and painfully, day after day, the little company of
  stragglers toiled on toward their distant homes, the redoubtable
  doctor, with his unwilling beast and his willing bond-woman, ever
  bringing up the rear. No one but Dora herself could know how
  grievously she suffered in her chains&#8212;how her very heart&#39;s
  blood was gradually consumed by the vampire whom she chose to cherish
  and obey because it was her misfortune to be his daughter.</p>

  <p>The old home was reached at last. On the whole, the doctor had
  rather enjoyed the journey, and brought to the family board, as of
  yore, a tremendous appetite. He &quot;resumed practice at the old
  stand&quot; without delay, publishing a card to that effect in the
  village newspaper. He seemed scarcely to note the absence of his
  wife, who for a quarter of a century had been wearing her life out in
  a vain endeavor to justify his existence on this globe. In short, he
  speedily settled back into his old habit of life, and appeared to
  have totally forgotten that he had come home to die. And Dora, too,
  soon lapsed into her old routine of schoolkeeping, and so once more
  the pot boiled merrily. Once a week, with scrupulous regularity, she
  wrote her promised letter to Posey, and she waited long and anxiously
  for some word from him, but in vain. Weary weeks lost themselves in
  months, and month after month crept slowly away till almost a year
  had passed, and still the faithful soul famished for some token that
  she was not forgotten. Then one evening she went home from her school
  to find that the heavens had fallen. Her father, whom she had left
  four hours before apparently in the highest health and <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 67]</span> spirits, was dead. The village physician
  attributed his sudden death to apoplexy, which seems illogical. But
  he was dead, whatever the cause, and his orphaned daughter mourned
  him with as genuine a grief as ever wrung a human heart.</p>

  <p>When in process of time the first transports of grief had subsided
  there seemed to be nothing left for Dora to do but to concentrate all
  the overflowing tenderness and devotion of her heart upon her lover,
  and to brood and pine over his long-continued silence. She never
  doubted that he had written to her, for the mail-service to and from
  the gold regions was notoriously unreliable in those days, and she
  was by no means the only one who looked in vain for letters thence.
  At last she could bear the suspense no longer. The spring had opened
  early, and a party in a neighboring town was to start for the
  diggings by the middle of April. This party, in which were already
  included two women, Dora resolved to join. Once let her reach that
  indefinite region denominated &quot;the mines,&quot; and she felt the
  most unquestioning faith in her ability to find her lover.</p>

  <p>And so once more the dauntless girl set out upon that long and
  tedious journey of three thousand miles. Not many weeks passed before
  the inevitable homeward-bound stragglers began to be encountered, and
  of these Dora eagerly sought information concerning the object of her
  quest.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bridge? No, marm,&quot; was almost uniformly the reply to
  her first question in that direction.</p>

  <p>&quot;He was sometimes called Posey,&quot; she would then suggest;
  and at last she found a man who acknowledged that he knew Posey.
  &quot;He was at the Buny Visty in Carter&#39;s Gulch at last
  accounts,&quot; this individual informed her, but he omitted to
  commit himself as to the nature of Posey&#39;s occupation.
  &quot;Wife, p&#39;r&#39;aps?&quot; he observed, incidentally.</p>

  <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; said Dora.</p>

  <p>&quot;Sister?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah! Well, he&#39;s a stocky chap, that Posey, and ought to
  make his fortune in the mines, if anybody could. But nobody
  can&#39;t&#8212;take my word for&#39;t. Look at me!&quot;</p>

  <p>He was a spectacle indeed. The retrogressive Doctor Hanchett had
  been quite an exquisite in the matter of apparel compared with this
  tatterdemalion. With Dora&#39;s companions he was less reticent
  concerning the character and calling of Posey than he had been with
  Dora herself. By his account it appeared that Posey had spent about a
  month in the mines without striking a single streak of luck to
  hearten him. At the end of that time, completely discouraged, he went
  to the nearest village and advertised himself as willing to work for
  his board at anything that might offer. The thing that offered was a
  situation as assistant bar-tender at the Buena Vista gambling-house.
  Posey accepted this situation with ardor, and discharged the delicate
  duties pertaining to the place so satisfactorily that he very soon
  found himself promoted to the distinguished position of &quot;stool
  pigeon.&quot; In this capacity he developed shining talents, and the
  Buena Vista&#39;s gaming-tables soon became the most famous resort in
  all that region for those confiding birds whose favorite amusement
  appears to lie in being plucked. And thus Posey went on prospering
  until he achieved a partnership in the concern; and his partner soon
  after being suddenly called to that bourne whence no traveler
  returns, Posey found himself sole proprietor and manager of an
  uncommonly flourishing concern in an uncommonly lively line of
  business.</p>

  <p>All this information was carefully kept by her companions from the
  ears of Dora, of course; and she, having obtained the long-coveted
  trace by means of which she felt sure that she could not fail to find
  her lover, was quite cheerful and happy throughout the remainder of
  the seemingly endless journey.</p>

  <p>The end neared at last, however, and as Dora recognized the
  familiar landmarks that told her she had almost reached the fruition
  of her hope deferred, her eyes brightened daily, a new flush came
  into her thin cheeks; and though <span class="pagenum">[pg 68]</span>
  she grew more quiet and abstracted than formerly, it was plain that
  her reveries had no tinge of darkness, her hope no shadow of fear,
  her faith no alloy of doubt. And when the time came for her to part
  with the good people in whose company she had traveled so far, she
  bade them adieu with a light heart, and at once set out alone by
  stage for Carter&#39;s Gulch.</p>

  <p>Reaching the straggling, ill-conditioned village at nightfall, she
  asked the driver, as she alighted in front of the stage-office, to
  direct her to the Buena Vista.</p>

  <p>&quot;The Buny Visty! The Buny Visty&#39;s not a hotel,
  ma&#39;am,&quot; that individual explained. &quot;It&#39;s the Golden
  Gate that you want, I reckon.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; she replied confidently. &quot;I have a
  friend at the Buena Vista&#8212;Mr.&#8212;Mr. Posey. Perhaps,&quot;
  she went on, with a little tremor in her voice, &quot;you can tell me
  if he is well?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Posey!&quot; He stopped some moments at the word and looked
  in blank amazement at the delicate, tender, unmistakably honest face
  that confronted him. Then he continued hastily: &quot;Never better.
  Saw him yesterday morning. You see that green lantern? That&#39;s the
  Buny Visty. Good-night, ma&#39;am. <i>I</i> stay here&#8212;if you
  should want a friend, you know. Good-night.&quot;</p>

  <p>Dora thanked him for his kindness, returned his salutation, and
  tripped away with unruffled spirits. She had been so much concerned
  to conceal her own agitation as she mentioned the name of her lover
  that she had quite overlooked the astonishment with which that name
  had seemed to transfix the driver.</p>

  <p>As she picked her way along the dark and muddy sidewalk she could
  not help complaining a little petulantly to herself because the
  stage-office had not been located nearer to that distant green
  lantern. But she was not the girl to lose heart now. Bravely she
  plodded on, and when at last she was able to discern the words
  &quot;Buena Vista&quot; upon the beacon toward which she was toiling,
  suddenly her heart gave a great bound, the tears rushed to her eyes,
  her knees quaked beneath her, and from her pious soul there went up
  an earnest thanksgiving to the dear Father of us all for His great
  mercy in bringing her safely to the end of her momentous journey.</p>

  <p>It was some minutes before she could so far compose herself as to
  be able to proceed; and when she did move forward again, I think a
  vague notion of the true character of the Buena Vista began to cast a
  shadow upon her ardor. As she came within a couple of rods of the
  isolated wooden building in front of which the green lantern was
  suspended she was suddenly startled at hearing several shots
  discharged in quick succession within, and a minute later three or
  four men rushed hastily into the street and hurried away, evidently
  without noticing her, though they passed within a few feet of her as
  she stood, almost paralyzed with alarm, just outside the door. Her
  fright was gone in a moment, however&#8212;soon enough, indeed, to
  enable her to satisfy herself that none of these fugitives was the
  man she sought. As the door stood wide open, there seemed nothing for
  her to do but enter, which she did at once. The front apartment of
  the saloon, though lighted, she found to be a mere ante-room, bare of
  all furniture save a few chairs; and without pausing here the
  resolute girl, who must have had a foreboding of the awful truth by
  this time, passed on into the gambling-room in the rear. There,
  stretched upon the floor, shot through the heart, lay the stark form
  of the man she had journeyed so far and so patiently and hopefully to
  find. He had grown muscular and brawny since she parted with him. His
  face, too, had changed, and not for the better: it was flushed,
  sodden and bearded, and the beard was dyed black. She knelt down
  beside the corpse and took one of the great hands in her own. It was
  still warm! But the chill of death crept over it as she held it to
  her heart, and thus her last ray of hope expired.</p>

  <p>She sat still by her dead till the man&#39;s former companions
  came to prepare the body for burial. As it was borne to the lonely
  grave upon the hillside she walked <span class="pagenum">[pg
  69]</span> beside the rough coffin. And when the grave was reached
  she dropped upon her knees beside it, and poured forth in a clear
  voice a fervent petition to the Most High to receive, for the sake of
  the dear Saviour who died for all the world, the soul of this poor
  sinner.</p>

  <p>They had said that she might bear up till the funeral was over,
  but that then she would break down. She did not. The next morning she
  set her face to the East, and began again, for the fourth time, that
  awful journey across the Plains. We need not follow her throughout
  its length. She reached her home worn and sick, but nevertheless at
  once took up her old school and went on with it a few weeks. And then
  the end came.</p>

      <p class="i2">In San Domenico, Francesca knelt.</p>

      <p class="i2">All day her charities had overflowed</p>

      <p class="i2">For others. Husband, children, friends had
      claimed</p>

      <p class="i2">Service ungrudged; the poor had gotten their
      dole,</p>

      <p class="i2">Doubled by reason of her soothing hands;</p>

      <p class="i2">Sick eyes had lifted at her coming, as lifts</p>

      <p class="i2">The parcht Campagna grass at the cool kisses</p>

      <p class="i2">Of winds that have been dallying with the snows</p>

      <p class="i2">Of Alban mountain-tops. And now, released</p>

      <p class="i2">From outward ministries, and free to turn</p>

      <p class="i2">Inward, and up the solemn aisle of thought</p>

      <p class="i2">Conduct her soul, she bowed with open page</p>

      <p class="i2">Before the altar: &quot;<i>Tenuisti manum</i></p>

      <p class="i2"><i>Dexteram meam</i>.&quot;</p>

      <p class="i20">On her lips she held</p>

      <p class="i2">The words caressingly, as she would taste</p>

      <p class="i2">Each syllable and drain its separate sweetness,</p>

      <p class="i2">When, breaking on her still seclusion, came</p>

      <p class="i2">A messenger: &quot;Sweet mistress, grace I
      pray!</p>

      <p class="i2">But unaware our lord hath come again,</p>

      <p class="i2">Bringing his gossips; and he bade me fetch</p>

      <p class="i2">My lady, if only for a one half hour,</p>

      <p class="i2">Saying the wine was flavorless without</p>

      <p class="i2">Her hand to pour it.&quot;</p>

      <p class="i20">At the word she rose,</p>

      <p class="i2">And unreluctant followed. No undertow</p>

      <p class="i2">Of hidden regret disturbed the azure calm</p>

      <p class="i2">Of those clear eyes that still reflected
      heaven.</p>

      <p class="i2">Then, when they all had drunk and been
      refreshed,</p>

      <p class="i2">And forth had ridden, Francesca sought her
      place,</p>

      <p class="i2">And pored again above the Psalter&#39;s leaf:</p>

      <p class="i2">&quot;<i>In voluntate tua
      deduxisti</i>,&quot;</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 70]</span>

      <p class="i2">Conning it over with a tender joy,</p>

      <p class="i2">As if she verily felt her human hand</p>

      <p class="i2">Close claspt in God&#39;s, and heard Him guiding
      her</p>

      <p class="i2">With audible counsel; when there fell a touch</p>

      <p class="i2">Upon her arm: &quot;The Sister Barbara</p>

      <p class="i2">Comes seeking wherewithal to dress some wounds</p>

      <p class="i2">Got in a brawl upon the Esquiline.&quot;</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">And now athwart the western windows streamed</p>

      <p class="i2">Rainbows of shafted light, as thither again</p>

      <p class="i2">Francesca came to read her &quot;Offices.&quot;</p>

      <p class="i2">A beam, that seemed a golden pencil held</p>

      <p class="i2">Within the fingers of the Christ that glowed</p>

      <p class="i2">In the great oriel, pointed to the words</p>

      <p class="i2">Where she had paused to do the Sister&#39;s

      <p class="i2">&quot;<i>Cum gloria suscepisti me</i>.&quot; She
      kissed</p>

      <p class="i2">The blazoned leaf, thanks nestling at her
      heart,</p>

      <p class="i2">That now, at last, no duty disallowing,</p>

      <p class="i2">Her loosened soul out through the sunset bars</p>

      <p class="i2">Might float, and catch heaven&#39;s crystal

      <p class="i2">Had meditation smoothed the wing of thought</p>

      <p class="i2">Before the hangings of the door were parted</p>

      <p class="i2">With yet a further summoning. From a Triton</p>

      <p class="i2">That spouted in the court her three-year boy,</p>

      <p class="i2">Who thither had climbed, had fallen, and naught
      would soothe</p>

      <p class="i2">The bruised brow save the sweet mother-kiss.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">&quot;I come,&quot; she said, her forehead half
      divine</p>

      <p class="i2">With saintly patience. &quot;For Thou wouldst teach
      me, Lord,</p>

      <p class="i2">That Thou art just as near me ministering</p>

      <p class="i2">At home as in these consecrated aisles;</p>

      <p class="i2">And &#39;tis true worship, pouring of the wine</p>

      <p class="i2">For him I love, or holding &#39;twixt my hands</p>

  <h2>OUR HOME IN THE TYROL.</h2><a name="tyrolchv" id="tyrolchv">

  <h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

  <p>We had not gone many yards when we noticed a grand old mansion
  with gray slopes of roof and stone galleries on arched pillars, and,
  asking its history, learned that it was a deserted seat of the counts
  of Arlberg, inhabited now by our guide in quality of forester, and
  where he had his sister Nanni and brother Hansel to live with
  him.</p>

  <p>We kept gradually ascending by the side of deep, turfy meadows,
  passing many a rich brown wooden chalet, with views ever and anon of
  our distant village and its stately Hof. Soon we turned into a woody
  gorge and began climbing the steep saddle of the Scharst; and as we
  slowly toiled upward in the pleasant summer air, amongst the aromatic
  fir trees, some verses came into my head out of a little German book,
  <i>Jakob Stainer</i>, by Herr Reif, which we had given as a parting
  present to Schuster Alois:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">The fiddle-maker Stainer</p>

      <p class="i4">Goes whistling on his way:</p>

      <p class="i2">A master like to Stainer</p>

      <p class="i4">Is not found every day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">He passes lofty beech trees,</p>

      <p class="i4">And old oaks stout and good,</p>

      <p class="i2">Because that which he seeks for</p>

      <p class="i4">Grows not in every wood.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">But yonder in the sunshine,</p>

      <p class="i4">Above the dark green shade,</p>

      <p class="i2">Behold a hazel-fir tree&#8212;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>&quot;Jörgel,&quot; said I, &quot;as you are a forester and know
  all the trees in the wood, I wish you would show me a hazel-fir
  tree.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Wohl gut</i>,&quot; he replied. &quot;Higher up the
  chances are small but what we pass one. I only pray the gracious
  Fräulein to say those verses over again.&quot;</p>

  <p>When I had done so he wished to know whether the fiddle-maker
  Stainer were a real man or no.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, good Jörgel,&quot; I replied, &quot;he was a real
  Tyroler like yourself, only you are not likely to have met with him,
  seeing that he died and was buried some two hundred years ago. Yes, a
  very real man, who did his work well, but to little profit. He was a
  peasant lad of Absam, who, probably going to Innspruck whilst the
  archduke Leopold and his Italian consort, Claudia dei Medici, kept
  their gay court there, thought Italian violins were harsh and
  unsatisfactory in tone, and so quietly worked out one of a different
  make from his own principles; which has since gained for him the name
  of &#39;the father of the German violin.&#39; He never expected to
  earn such a title. He had begun making violins when he was twenty: he
  worked very slowly, only made a few, and sold them at a moderate
  price to the foreign dealers who came to the fairs at Hall. They soon
  became asked after, for they excelled as instruments from the first
  moment that they were touched, and retain to this day the clearest
  and the fullest notes, like the middle tones of the flute,
  wonderfully sympathetic and rich. The peculiar excellency is probably
  owing to the extreme care which he showed in the selection of the
  wood. He used the hazel-fir tree, it is said. He selected the wood
  himself, striking the trunk with his hammer to hear its tones before
  he felled it. He would wander for days through the mountain forests
  searching suitable trees. He studied each one, and only chose that
  which exactly answered his purpose&#8212;generally those of which the
  topmost boughs were already dead.</p>

  <p>&quot;When wood was being precipitated down the mountain-slides,
  he would seat himself in some safe spot near at hand, and listen to
  the different tones which the trunks uttered as they struck against
  the rocks in their fall. He chose from these &#39;singing trees&#39;
  those which pleased his ear the most. He was also particular about
  the rings on the stems of the felled trees. They must be harmonious
  and regular, neither too near nor too far apart. For those portions
  of the violin which were made in separate pieces he <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 72]</span> used very old wood, preferring old inner
  doors and wainscoting.</p>

  <p>&quot;Although one of the most celebrated violin-makers that ever
  lived, this peasant always remained poor. It is true that one grand
  duke favored him, but then his patron died, and whilst the emperor
  permitted him to be the court fiddle-maker, he was scandalized, like
  the rest of the world, by his reading Lutheran books, picked up in
  the market at Hall. These books caused him to be thrown into prison
  as a heretic, and although in time released, debts and poverty
  embittering his life, he became introverted and melancholy, until
  finally the humble, patient worker, who had sent forth so much melody
  into the world, was strapped to the wooden bench of his cottage at
  Absam, a heart-broken maniac. The merciful messenger Death released
  him after several years, but the bench and the hole in the wood by
  means of which he was bound may still be seen.</p>

  <p>&quot;When the artist was forgotten his works increased greatly in
  value. This occasioned other makers to endeavor to multiply their
  number, introducing many spurious Stainer violins, which gradually
  brought down the market value. Nevertheless, genuine Stainer violins
  are recognizable, and still retain a fancy price. Mozart possessed
  one which he greatly prized, using it as his solo quartette
  instrument. It belongs now to a professor in the Mozarteum at
  Salzburg, and was played upon at the Mozart festival in 1856.</p>

  <p>&quot;But a violin with a still more remarkable history figured
  during the festivities attending the marriage of the present emperor
  of Austria. During the visit of the emperor Charles VI., King
  Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia and other princes to the great nobleman
  Count Wenzel von Trautmannsdorf, the generous and lavish host became
  sorely perplexed how to provide George Stezitzky, a splendid
  violinist, with a suitable instrument. At this point he opportunely
  heard that there was an old fiddler in the court who begged
  permission to play before the august company. The request being
  granted, the musician commenced playing, and immediately sent princes
  and nobles into raptures over the tones of his violin. The count
  therefore stopped him, and offered to buy it. This quite threw the
  old man into despair. &#39;It was a Stainer violin,&#39; he replied,
  &#39;and his whole livelihood was bound up in it.&#39; The count,
  however, was not to be thwarted: he gave him fifty ducats for the
  piece he had played, and then concluded the bargain on the following
  conditions: three hundred gulden for the violin, besides a house to
  live in, food and a quart of wine daily; ten gulden monthly, two
  barrels of beer and one suit of clothes yearly, fruit and as many
  hares as he needed for his kitchen. The agreement having been
  concluded, George Stezitzky played a solo on the violin: then
  received it as a present from the count. The man who had parted with
  it lived sixteen years more, thus costing the count in actual money
  8733 florins 20 kreuzers, equal to 10,380 florins 24 kreuzers of the
  present currency. A large sum to give for a violin.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Jörgel, who appeared to have been much
  interested by the whole history; &quot;but what puzzles me is, how a
  poor devil who worked so slow could be a genius. I thought sharp
  people took more after the Almighty, and hurried up their work in the
  twinkling of an eye.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do the trees which you look after shoot up in the twinkling
  of an eye?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, no. Good, stout wood, with strength enough to resist
  storms and to cleave to the rocks of these mountainsides, takes a
  lifetime. I often warn the peasants against cutting their trees down.
  It is easy to destroy, but not to build up, I tell them; and the
  trees as they stand are the best preventatives against
  land-slips.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Have you always been a forester?&quot; we asked.</p>

  <p>Not he. It was true that in fine weather he often wandered for
  thirty miles a day, his district reaching as far, but he had seen
  more of the world than these fir woods. He had been in the habit, as
  a young man, of taking horses for sale into Italy, where he had seen
  Milan cathedral and the town-hall in Bergamo. <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 73]</span> He, however, gave up his trade in 1831, as
  his father died in that year of dropsy, and his mother ten days after
  of sorrow, and he thought it only right to stay with his sister
  Nanni. Franz had gone off and married a rich widow against his
  advice, for he knew she would treat a second husband as a
  day-laborer; and what he had predicted proved true. However, she and
  her money were gone out of the family now. Her body lay in the
  graveyard, and he supposed that the priest who said masses for her
  soul knew where it was by this time. As for Hansel, he was still at
  liberty, and had well played his part in the world. He had protected
  the emperor Ferdinand when he fled with his consort to Innspruck in
  1848, standing as sentinel at the gate of the faithful city. Later on
  he had marched with the Tyrolese imperial Jäger corps into Hungary,
  and fought for the same master there. Again in 1866 he was righting
  under the archduke Albert, until, on the feast of Johanni, he was
  disabled at the battle of Custozza by a wound in his foot. The
  victory over the Italians made him for a time forget the pain, but
  afterward it grew dreadful, lasting for seventeen months, and not an
  army surgeon could help him. Then, however, he determined to try a
  cow-doctor, who in two weeks set him on his pins again.</p>

  <p>&quot;And you might not believe it,&quot; continued Jörgel, who
  grew animated in his narration, &quot;but I too have seen service. In
  the last war between Italy and Austria the students of Innspruck
  formed a corps, and young Count Arlberg, being an active volunteer,
  proposed that I should go as cook. The motion was carried, and I
  marched with one hundred and ninety-three young gentlemen to Bira.
  Sometimes with help and sometimes with none, I cooked for them all. I
  fed them on meat dumplings and plenten, until in a few weeks the cook
  and the <i>soldaten</i>&#8212;or the cook and the <i>salaten</i>,
  which you will&#8212;had to pull up stakes and beat an honorable
  retreat through the Breimer. At Brixen I bade farewell to my
  regiment, and have since, under Count Arlberg the father, looked
  after stocks and stones, and not soldiers. Well, well! Austria has
  lost Italy, but the Tyrol can hold up its head, for it stands now as
  a great natural rampart between the two countries.&quot;</p>

  <p>We had been resting during Jörgel&#39;s narration: the long rays
  of the declining sun now warned us to hasten on. Margaret, full of
  energy and desirous of pushing forward up the almost vertical path,
  soon began to lag behind. Thus I, looking back and waiting for her,
  saw a comely peasant-woman who, quickly climbing the hill behind,
  offered her the assistance of her arm. Although this was gratefully
  declined, the stranger, apparently troubled at the sight of the tired
  lady, tarried at her side, trying to be of service. She had a
  melodious voice and a restful air, which made us, though she was but
  a poor illiterate woman, feel better for her presence. Thus she was
  allowed to carry our shawls, and whenever we rested she strayed into
  wayside glens, returning with offerings of mellow bilberries; and
  finally she cheered our lagging energies with the assurance that we
  should soon see blue sky peeping through the trees, and that then
  there would be no more climbing. At this point, Jörgel, who had been
  carefully examining each tree as we passed, expressed his fear that
  no actual hazel-fir tree grew along this path. He, however, pointed
  out a well grown fir tree, saying that a <i>hazelfichte</i> merely
  possessed a straighter and a smoother stem.</p>

  <p>We had begun truly to descend, and our friendly woman, seeing that
  &quot;Shank&#39;s mare&quot; required no further encouragement, bade
  us a friendly good-evening, with a cheerful &quot;May you live long
  and well!&quot; She had almost dipped out of sight when our Jörgel,
  with praiseworthy forethought, called after her to apprise the bath
  people, as she passed, of our advent.</p>

  <p>The path had become broader and more beaten. There was a gradual
  sense of some human being, either from personal or unselfish
  interests, having once been at work to make the woods still more
  attractive and enjoyable. Benches of flat stones were raised at
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 74]</span> points where snow-fields,
  fantastic and stern dolomite peaks and wooded slopes formed exquisite
  pictures set in frames of stately, well-grown fir trees&#8212;here a
  smooth lawn with its little shrine and wooden seat for the wayfarer
  to meditate on the Flight into Egypt, which Jörgel called the
  &quot;witches&#39; ground;&quot; there, under a spreading tree, a
  rural table and seats&#8212;proofs that we must be approaching the
  bath-house; and no little were we pleased by these signs of care and
  judgment, especially as none of the rural bowers were either bran-new
  or in a state of decay, but harmonizing with the tidy negligence of
  the woods themselves.</p>

  <p>&quot;These paths promise well for the baths,&quot; we remarked to
  Jörgel.</p>

  <p>&quot;Might have done so once,&quot; he replied, &quot;but it was
  the old Frau Wirthin who put them up. She was a woman with a head and
  a will, and she took a pride in the place, seeing that the baths are
  as old as the mountains, and they had been in her family since the
  Lord made the Tyrol. Now they are in the hands of her son Seppl and
  his sister Moidel. However, I never mix myself up in what does not
  concern me. The master is at liberty, and so is she, and it is not
  for me or my old Nanni to speak against unmarried people. Both they
  and we are bound for <i>Herzing</i> when we die, the spinsters to
  howl in the moor and we men in the wood. That is what the lads and
  lasses say of us;&quot; and he gave a dry little laugh. &quot;Ask my
  opinion of the water, and I&#39;ll answer you straightforward.
  It&#39;s an elixir, a perfect elixir;&quot; and he repeated the
  sentence with the proud consciousness of using a dictionary word.
  &quot;As for the house, the master and the old maid, judge for
  yourselves, or ask them that sent you here.&quot;</p>

  <p>So saying, he sturdily marched on ahead, as if fearing to be
  compromised. We did not feel encouraged, especially with night
  steadily falling down upon us. Still less was the future hopeful when
  Jörgel pointed with his stick in advance, exclaiming, &quot;Arrived
  at last!&quot;</p>

  <p>Yes, arrived at an old weatherbeaten chalet, with a crazy barn to
  keep it company, dilapidated and tottering as if in the bankruptcy
  court, standing abruptly on the borders of the black fir wood, the
  air filled with the odor of concentrated pigstye; dark male figures
  playing at skittles on the path, and having to stop the game to
  enable us to reach the door; black male figures playing at cards and
  drinking wine in the dusky, close old parlor or <i>stube</i>, made
  still more gloomy by the large, projecting brick stove, unlighted at
  this season of the year.</p>

  <p>We should never have proceeded on a voyage of discovery had not
  the thick folds of a woman&#39;s yellow petticoat flickered before us
  on the steps of a smoke-stained ladder.</p>

  <p>Jörgel, who, with the utmost determination, resolved to fulfill
  his duty as guide, marshaled us up this old creaking ladder, then up
  a second, until we stopped in an open gallery sheltered by the wooden
  eaves, where a feeble old woman nursed an idiot child in the
  gloaming. And yet what a landscape to relieve this desolate
  foreground!&#8212;slumbrous mountains, dewy meadows, peaceful
  villages, over which the calm of Sunday lay. We stood drinking in the
  tranquil scene, when a woman in blue apron and of rapid motion
  quickly touched my elbow with a large key; and bidding us follow she
  hastily flung open the door of a narrow wainscoted closet, smelling
  of hay. &quot;She had no other room,&quot; she blurted forth, and
  then, without word of apology, disappeared as speedily as she had
  come. We found ourselves the owners of two large bedsteads and two
  dilapidated chairs: everywhere in the house we had caught glimpses of
  broken-backed chairs, witnesses either of poverty or riot.</p>

  <p>A modest tap at the door announced worthy Jörgel. He tried to
  comfort us in his rough and honest way, with &quot;They that sent you
  here are to blame.&quot;</p>

  <p>We interrupted him, saying that the fault lay with ourselves.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, well! how could you tell? But have no fears. This
  house is disorderly for the want of a head, but remember, there&#39;s
  an elixir of life in the water. I&#39;m very much satisfied with what
  you have paid me, and the next time we meet we <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 75]</span> shall regard each other as old
  acquaintance.&quot;</p>

  <p>He lifted his empty <i>kraxe</i> upon his shoulders, and went out.
  We waited to see his square figure appear in the path below, like
  those who were parting not only from a friend, but a protector. It
  was some minutes before he was visible. We discovered shortly
  afterward that not wishing to leave us in our desolation, and
  perceiving that some &quot;Herrschaft&quot; must be in the house, as
  the best room had not been given us, he had boldly introduced himself
  to them, and thus we found ourselves committed by Jörgel to a fresh
  Good Samaritan in the shape of a well-to-do draper&#39;s wife, Frau
  T&#8212;&#8212;. We knew her by name, but did not deal at her shop.
  Still, she was ruled by no selfish thoughts, and out of the genuine
  kindliness of her heart she joyfully fulfilled Jörgel&#39;s
  commission. It was she who insisted on preparing our supper; it was
  her cloth that was spread on the table in the gallery as the
  quietest, most suitable spot in the riotous house, she smoothing our
  scruples by declaring it her pleasure, only regretting that we should
  have arrived on such a noisy night, for the house was usually very
  still. It was her servant who showed the deaf old woman, the one help
  of the establishment, how to make our beds.</p>

  <p>The aged crone, Nanni&#8212;half the female population of the
  Tyrol are called either after the Virgin Mary or her traditionary
  mother, Saint Ann&#8212;gazed in intense astonishment when we
  screamed to her our simple requirements. We asked for a light, and
  she brought us a tallow candle stuck in a bottle. We asked for a
  pitcher of water, and she muttered something about the spout.</p>

  <p>Worn-out, weary, very grateful to the good Frau T&#8212;&#8212;,
  we went to bed, but not to sleep. That would have been a vain
  endeavor, for shrill laughter, loud words and boisterous songs, in
  which the high tones of wild female voices rose painfully above the
  gruff singing of half-besotted men, penetrated the room, whilst the
  old rafters groaned and creaked from the heavy tramp of dancers
  below. All our belief in the sobriety and goodness of the Tyrolese
  seemed swept away, and a sense of their coarseness and dissipation to
  have taken its place. We were in a very pandemonium, which never
  ceased until the sun was rising.</p>

  <p>Nor was the evil mitigated when we learned from the landlord&#39;s
  sister a few hours later that the guests were only returning from
  Scapulary Sunday in Reischach. Most of them belonged to the next
  village, and had rested here on their way. After prayers it was right
  to sing and dance: why should they not? And, look you, when wine got
  into people&#39;s head, what could she do? She could not turn them
  out.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, but the master, her brother, might.&quot;</p>

  <p>She shook her head ominously, and hurried into the kitchen&#8212;a
  smoky old kitchen, but quaint from the little windows with the old
  ox-eyed panes of thick glass.</p>

  <p>It impressed itself forcibly on our minds that Seppl had
  compromised himself on the preceding night. He was to be seen
  nowhere; only the bustling sister Moidel, who had already swept out
  and cleaned the scene of the late dissipation, and was now busy over
  our coffee, and the old Nanni, who with bare feet and wet petticoats
  intimated that she had scrubbed the female bath-room and placed two
  freshly scoured tubs there at our disposition.</p>

  <p>Both women meant kindly by us: the pleasant fir woods and the
  fresh air seemed to whisper to us to stay. So we gave up the plan
  which we had resolutely made in the night of leaving that very
  morning, and by so doing found Bad Scharst not only endurable, but
  really, in a very rough and ready way, enjoyable. The remembrance of
  the wild, riotous night even became enveloped with a certain interest
  when we recollected that this grim attempt at pleasure was in sober
  reality one of those Tyrolese peasant balls which are represented in
  such fair and attractive colors on the stage, in pictures or in
  novels. It was well to be undeceived, and to see the deep shadows as
  well as the bright side of Tyrolese life.</p><span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 76]</span>

  <p>And what matter if for one night we had lost our sleep, whilst we
  breathed exhilarating ozone and drank water which, to quote Jörgel,
  was truly an elixir of life? For all our temporary and trifling
  inconveniences we found rich compensation when after an easy ascent
  of two hours we reached the topmost platform of the mountain, the
  Kronplatz. To the north, reaching from east to west, a long, unbroken
  chain of glaciers, from the Furtschläg to the Gross Venediger Spitze
  with its untrodden snows. Below us, at some four thousand feet, the
  broad, rich Pusterthal, with its comfortable villages and its
  pastoral tributary valleys. To the south, the stern limestone peaks
  of the dolomite region; the Vedretta Marmolata, with its breastplate
  of ice, king of these barbaric giants, the splintered pinnacles of
  the Drei Zinnen, the pyramidal Antalao, and many another jagged,
  appalling mountain, stern as the bewildering doctrines of election
  and reprobation, whilst the pure glistening snow, green meadows and
  pleasant woods opposite seemed to breathe forth the gentle, winning
  truths of the glad tidings of peace.</p>

  <p>It was delicious to lie on the short turf in an ethereal region
  with a perception of the burden and heat of the day in the valley
  below; yet the fresh breeze of the mountain drove us with a sense of
  hunger back to the baths.</p>

  <p>Having spoken of the scenery, let us now speak of the guests.
  There were not many. Frau T&#8212;&#8212;, ourselves and a young
  woman, a sewing-machinist, occupied the available chambers of the
  chalet. The rest were used as receptacles for hay and milk: the
  ground floor contained the <i>stube</i>, the kitchen, the pigstye, or
  rather the room set apart for the pig, and the cow-house. Several
  poor guests, men and woman, hovered about the door of the barn. They
  slept in the various lofts, divided into rooms, and cooked for
  themselves in a common kitchen adjoining the bath-rooms. These were
  two long wooden sheds, in which rows of large tubs were placed. The
  patients bathed twice a day, being covered over with boards and a
  horse-rug, but the head was left free. There was no doctor: each
  could doctor himself by lying in the hot water and drinking more or
  fewer glasses of the iron water daily. It poured from a spout into a
  wooden trough between the chalet and the barn; and this explained old
  Nanni&#39;s mutterings after our arrival.</p>

  <p>Although the peasant bathers as a class made no distinct
  impression on us, the half dozen men looking like facsimiles of each
  other, and the seven women appearing always to be one and the same,
  still there were one or two figures which stand prominently forth,
  from the more direct relations into which we came with them.</p>

  <p>First, an old peasant-woman, whom we heard, as we descended from
  the Kronplatz, singing to a crying baby as we approached the
  house:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i2">Engeli, Bengeli, wilt thou go to America?</p>

    <p class="i2">Rumelti, Pumelti, wilt thou go to England?</p>
  </div>

  <p>She instantly stopped her ditty when she saw us emerge from the
  wood.</p>

  <p>Curious, was it not? and yet we had neither brought our passports
  with us, nor had we followed the example of previous guests and
  proved our learning by writing our names and birthplaces in the
  visitors&#39; book&#8212;a large volume for which every door-lintel
  and piece of wainscot in the house acted as leaves. No, but some
  little bird had been whispering about us on the mountain-side.</p>

  <p>The next figure is another peasant-woman, tall and somewhat thin,
  with a patient, beseeching look in her face. This I quietly perceived
  whilst I sat busily writing near the house at a table which Moidel
  had carried out for me, yet I would not look up, because she stood
  eyeing me with an innocent stare, as if wishful to enter into
  conversation. A few minutes later a buxom matron stepped forth from
  the passage of the chalet. It acted as a convenient thoroughfare on
  the road between Reischach and Geisselburg. Her daughter, a girl of
  sixteen, who was with her, wore two beaver hats, the uppermost
  evidently bran-new and a fresh purchase. The first peasant-woman
  addressed the <span class="pagenum">[pg 77]</span> newcomer with a
  &quot;God greet thee, Trina! Thou hast been shopping, I
  see.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;God greet thee, Gertraud! It is only a new hat for the
  moidel. We were going down for Scapulary Sunday; so I thought I might
  go on to town and sell thirty pounds of cow-hair, the savings of ten
  years; for, now there&#39;s to be a railway, beds are wanted, and as
  I received more than I expected, Moidel got her hat.&quot;</p>

  <p>Then lowering her voice and pointing in my direction: &quot;One of
  the strange ladies? I saw the other in the wood gathering
  strawberries. I heard she came from America, but she was quite
  pretty, without either black skin or thick lips. There must be some
  mistake. But, Gertraud, how&#39;s the sick little maid?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very weak&#8212;cannot last long. The doctor was up
  yesterday, and he said it was useless his coming again: however, he
  left it something soothing. Adieu, Trina: greet all at
  home.&quot;</p>

  <p>At first amused by the notions these fellow-creatures possessed of
  us, then forgetting them in the trouble which I perceived occupied
  the poor woman&#39;s mind, I lifted up my head when her friends were
  gone and inquired if she had a sick child.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, na, na! not of my own. I&#39;m nursing a little maid of
  five years old: the father is a government postilion and the mother
  in service, and so she brought her up here to see if the air and the
  water would strengthen her. She is their only child. No, I myself
  live about an hour from here: you can see my cottage amongst the
  cherry trees on the slopes yonder. It looks nearer than it is, for
  there is a hidden ravine between. Ah, Herr je! I&#39;ve had children
  too, and have had to give them all up. They are waiting for me with
  the dear God; but, Herr je! it&#39;s long toiling and hoping to reach
  them. However, you&#39;ll oblige me and tell me where you have really
  come from?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;From Rome,&quot; was the reply.</p>

  <p>&quot;Mein Gott! as far off as heaven! The creation is frightfully
  big! Well, I must not loiter. I came out to say a prayer, then to
  chop wood for Moidel.&quot;</p>

  <p>An hour later, while sitting at supper in the passage, the most
  convenient and quiet place as we imagined, we found all the guests
  marching past us, each saluting us with &quot;A good appetite to
  you!&quot; or else &quot;May you eat well!&quot; They had been called
  together by Frau T&#8212;&#8212; and the sewing-machinist, Fraülein
  Magdalena, for Rosenkranz.</p>

  <p>Hardly were they kneeling in the chapel, a small building at the
  farther side of the chalet, when the pig marched also up the passage,
  and grunting out his &quot;Guten appetit,&quot; proposed taking his
  place at our table. We drove him out of doors: he waited behind the
  house corner to avoid detection until we were comfortably seated,
  when again he was at our side, snuffing the dishes in the air and
  grunting his &quot;Guten appetit.&quot;</p>

  <p>We were in despair. Moidel was not forthcoming, and we found that
  we could not shut the door against our intruding visitor.</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Was thust du? Na, na! Draus, draus, Kloane</i>!&quot;
  (&quot;What dost thou? No, no! Out with thee, little one!&quot;),
  said a voice in the passage; and a short man, with a good-natured,
  half-foolish face, after releasing himself from a heavily-laden
  basket which he carried on his back, walked through the passage and
  out of the farther door, attended by the pig, who lovingly rubbed his
  snout against him. The stranger knelt down at one of the shattered
  windows of the chapel, his four-footed companion standing patiently
  by him, until the orison was over and the worshipers trooped out of
  the little chapel. Then the knowing pig trotted off to his own
  quarters, whilst one voice exclaimed, &quot;You are back again,
  Seppl?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You&#39;ve not forgotten my bread?&quot; said a second.</p>

  <p>&quot;You&#39;ve brought me the knitting needles?&quot; said a
  third.</p>

  <p>&quot;You left the letter at the Lamb and Flag?&quot; added a
  fourth.</p>

  <p>This, then, was the master, evidently the common messenger of all,
  who, whilst the guests called him behind his back &quot;Headless
  Seppl,&quot; had managed to fulfill two dozen verbal commissions
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 78]</span> to everybody&#39;s satisfaction.
  This was the landlord, whom we had pictured lying in a drunken
  lethargy in some hay barn after the bout of the night before. How we
  had maligned an evidently simple, honest soul, who had been toiling
  from early morning, and who, having discharged the orders of his
  different customers, started up the steep mountain-side, and we heard
  him calling &quot;<i>Koos, koos, koos</i>,&quot; lovingly to his
  cows! It was only when he had milked them, patted them, called each
  by its name, seen them comfortably housed for the night, that he had
  time to think of resting or eating his dumplings for supper.</p>

  <p>It was the fourth morning of our stay, and we were preparing to
  leave. Seppl&#39;s basket was already packed with our belongings, and
  he, the good beast of burden, had orders in half an hour to act as
  our guide, when suddenly Moidel flew out of the kitchen, exclaiming,
  &quot;He is coming! he is coming!&quot; and wiping her arms on her
  apron rushed down the green meadows beyond the chapel. Fräulein
  Magdalena, dropping her work, uttered a joyful cry. &quot;Yes, it is
  he! it&#39;s Herr Pflersch!&quot; she said, turning to us. &quot;The
  king of Bad Scharst. Ah! why don&#39;t you stay, for glorious days
  will begin? I&#39;ve been here eleven years at the same time as Herr
  Pflersch, and we have none of us gone to bed for seven days together.
  We play at cards and he tells us tales.&quot;</p>

  <p>The excitement in the whole establishment became universal. Herr
  Pflersch was our grocer, a burly, good-natured man, who bowed
  politely to us when he arrived at the house, led by a troop of
  admiring and rejoicing friends. He was attended by his cook, and had
  brought with him a sackful of provisions and his feather bed, which
  came toiling up the hill in a cart.</p>

  <p>Fräulein Magdalena stood rapturously before the welcome guest,
  offering him a quart glass of water: &quot;No beer to offer you, Herr
  Pflersch, but glorious water, Herr Pflersch.&quot;</p>

  <p>Moidel apologized for not going a step of the way with us,
  &quot;But Herr Pflersch had come;&quot; and whilst she said so she
  began putting one of Herr Pflersch&#39;s own wax candles into a brass
  candlestick. &quot;I have, however, a favor to ask of you,&quot; she
  continued: &quot;that is, if we ever happen to meet on the high-road
  in the Pusterthal, you&#39;ll allow me to recognize you.&quot; A
  humble request indeed, poor soul!</p>

  <p>Gertraud came down from the barn to say good-bye to us. The
  &quot;little maid&quot; was still lingering, but she added
  mysteriously, &quot;She&#39;ll be knocking thrice at her mother&#39;s
  door to-morrow.&quot;</p>

  <p>Walking across the meadows, this time taking a different way from
  that by which we had arrived, we met several groups of peasant-men
  carrying bundles in their hands, who asked Seppl if the Herr had
  arrived, and being answered in the affirmative, they hurried on, as
  if desirous to act as Knights of the Round Table to King
  Pflersch.</p><a name="tyrolchvi" id="tyrolchvi">

  <h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

  <p>In sending word to Anton to fetch us from the inn at Nieder Olang
  that especial afternoon, we had not been aware that we had chosen a
  place and hour when most of the pious male Catholics were gathered
  thither to accord an unflinching, unequivocal assent to the
  Infallibility dogma, as well as to condemn from the bottom of their
  clerical or rustic souls the foul heresy of Old Catholicism, which
  was spreading far and wide in the adjoining kingdom of Bavaria. Most
  of the farmers and all the parish priests were assembled. The
  spacious <i>Widum</i> or parsonage, in festal array, kept open house,
  the large church was full to overflowing, whilst the ample inn being
  still more crammed we preferred waiting for Anton in a shady nook
  opposite. Here we had ample leisure to observe the rows of clerical
  and bucolic backs ranged against the open inn windows, and to listen
  to the hum of serious voices, sounding as if a spiritual mass meeting
  were being held over seitels of wine. It was a curious sight a
  quarter of an hour later, the conclave being at an end, to watch the
  priests flocking forth, some so <span class="pagenum">[pg 79]</span>
  old and shabby, in such stained, rusty frockcoats, that their very
  assumption of dignity appeared painfully grotesque; others, more
  scrupulously clean, displayed with pride a blue silk ribbon bound as
  an order across their breasts; but whether shabby or decent, whether
  singly or in groups, they were invariably received bareheaded by the
  respectful villagers waiting outside, whilst a double salvo of homage
  was awarded by priest and layman to a tall, elegant Italian monsignor
  from Brixen, who, tucking up gracefully his rich violet garments,
  walked with infinite care from the inn to the Widum, disappearing
  from view under the gateway.</p>

  <p>All the clergy now departing in various directions were
  complacently chuckling over the security of their position, their
  quiet, unquestioning sheep obediently following whithersoever they
  might lead them. It was not always so in the Tyrol. In former ages,
  especially at the time of the Reformation, the people had used their
  independent judgment, allowing themselves neither to be oppressed nor
  led astray. In these latter days, however, their freer, nobler
  instincts have been overpowered by the marvelous, almost incredible,
  influence of the Jesuits. In the last century, when this order was
  suppressed, the Tyrolese gymnasiums were immediately improved,
  schools for the people were opened, and such was the spirit of the
  age that the barons Sternbach, Turn, Taxis and other noblemen became
  Freemasons&#8212;an act which their descendants, now shackled with
  Jesuitical influences, regard with the deepest horror. After the
  revolution of 1848 a spirit of reaction arose in the Tyrol, which
  holds the people back, retards progress and keeps the country far
  behind other European lands.</p>

  <p>A very embodiment of this retrograding subordination stood before
  us in the form of Seppl, who, dull, poor both in mind and pocket,
  still lingered entranced with wonder and amazement at a power which
  appeared to him capable of governing both earth and heaven.</p>

  <p>Rich bauers and poor laborers in this peaceful, wealthy portion of
  the Tyrol become daily more blindly attached to the priests. Should
  there happen to be a thinker amongst them, he must keep his
  questionings to himself: he will find no sympathy in his neighbors.
  In towns such as Innsbruck, however, he will discover many fellows,
  for a feeling of reaction has awakened there a more liberal,
  independent spirit.</p>

  <p>If Seppl might be taken as an extreme type of the provincial mode
  of thought, so might a young student with whom we shortly became
  acquainted be regarded as representing that of the town. Pursuing a
  long course of medical studies at the Innsbruck University, he
  implied rather by his actions than by any outward expressions that he
  regarded his worthy country relations as zealots, absented himself
  from Rosenkranz and long family graces, and spoke compassionately of
  his relatives as being &quot;very naïve;&quot; and these simple,
  unsophisticated people in their turn, though staggered by this spirit
  of quiet innovation and rebellion in their midst, made their minds
  easy on the score that a man of the world, such as he was, and
  honorably providing for himself, could not be expected to be such as
  they were. He had not time for prayers and confessions: he must
  study, and then must enjoy relaxation; but some of their extra
  petitions might be put to his account. Not that this was ever
  expressed in so many words: it was rather from our own quiet
  observations that we drew these inferences. Nor did opportunities
  fail, seeing that our new acquaintance was in fact no other than the
  &quot;Herr Student,&quot; the saintly personage whom we had imagined
  in long black Noah&#39;s Ark coat, wearing the orthodox clerical
  stock embroidered with blue and white beads, leading Rosenkranz, and,
  should we ever have the honor of his acquaintance, saying three Ave
  Marias before conversing with heretics.</p>

  <p>Instead of this, behold a good-looking, cheerful young man in gold
  spectacles, wearing a suit the color of ripe chestnuts, who, whilst
  we began impatiently to look for Anton, appeared before us like a
  good genius from the inn, introduced <span class="pagenum">[pg
  80]</span> himself and apologized that we should have been kept
  waiting. &quot;I regret,&quot; he added, &quot;that I was not aware
  of your arrival until the kellnerin pointed you out through the
  window; otherwise I should have taken the liberty to explain to you
  that my brother may be a little late. He brought me and two friends
  over earlier in the day, and had then to attend to a little business.
  <i>Mein compliment</i>;&quot; and with a low bow he returned to the
  inn.</p>

  <p>We no longer anxiously inquired of each other whether the
  ever-ready Anton had received our message, rather whether we had not
  put him to considerable inconvenience when there was business of the
  Hofbauer&#39;s to be attended to. And next, how in the world, if the
  Herr Student, who had so suddenly appeared on the scene, were here
  with two friends, we could all return in the gig?</p>

  <p>Nor did this dilemma seem likely to decrease when we spied in the
  far distant windings of the road, dotted over with the receding black
  groups of priests and their supporters, a moving object approaching
  in our direction bearing unmistakable resemblance to the gig and
  broad-backed horse, but with a female figure seated behind
  Anton&#8212;a perplexity which grew greater when, the distance
  becoming less, the figure assumed a still more elegant form, holding
  a fashionable sunshade in her hand, which suddenly began to wave
  persistently in our direction.</p>

  <p>Who could it be? We imagined, we hoped, we doubted, until ten
  minutes later our astonishment ended in a joyous reality as we
  clasped in our arms our dear, friend E&#8212;&#8212;. She had arrived
  in our absence on a visit to us at the Hof, and the good family,
  desirous of affording us a joyful surprise, had proposed that Anton
  should drive her over to meet us at Nieder Olang. The Herr Student
  was in the secret. This had made him prudently cut our conversation
  short and return to his friends in the inn.</p>

  <p>E&#8212;&#8212; brought bouquets of flowers for us from the aunt
  and Moidel, but there was no reason for us to hurry back: there were
  still several hours of daylight. The sturdy horse having already
  accomplished some eighteen or twenty miles since morning, made no
  objection to a rest and feed of hay in the stable, whilst Anton was
  content to sit with his brother and his two friends in the
  <i>stube</i> before the trio started on foot for the Hof. It seemed
  rather a desire to show the strangers the neighborhood than any
  inclination to attend the clerical meeting which had brought the Herr
  Student to Nieder Olang this afternoon. And we, glad of an hour&#39;s
  delay, started immediately with E&#8212;&#8212;, the sunny summer
  afternoon made brighter by this joyous meeting, to visit the
  adjoining hamlet of Mitter Olang.</p>

  <p>The three small adjacent villages of Upper, Middle and Lower
  Olang, lying amongst monotonous fields and destitute themselves of
  any picturesque beauty, would be passed over by the stranger as
  totally devoid of interest; but, thanks to Dr. Staffler&#39;s
  topographical work, <i>Das deutsche Tirol und Voralberg</i>, the
  mention of Peter Sigmair of Mitter Olang had excited a strong desire
  in us to see the spot where he had lived and died.</p>

  <p>After the battle of Austerlitz, in 1805, the defeated emperor of
  Austria signed a treaty with Napoleon ceding Venice to the French and
  the Tyrol to their ally, Bavaria. The Tyrolese thus found themselves
  suddenly separated from an empire the fortunes of which they had
  shared for some five hundred years. If the country had outwardly
  become Bavarian, the hearts of the people remained essentially
  Austrian, and bitterly did they resent having to obey a government in
  league with the French, the sworn foe of Austria. Thus they
  determined on the first opportunity to throw off the hated yoke. The
  Bavarians had promised by the treaty to leave intact the Tyrolese
  constitution. They soon, however, forced the young men into the army
  to fight their battles, dissolved the religious houses, and
  eventually dismissed both bishops and parish priests. This was more
  than these extremely religious people could brook. The Bavarians had
  broken faith in not preserving the constitution: <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 81]</span> now they were free from their oath, they
  declared. In this sentiment the emperor of Austria warmly seconded
  them, and secret plots of rebellion began speedily to ferment through
  the land. In 1809, the memorable, never-to-be-forgotten year
  <i>Nine</i> of Tyrolese history, the earnestly longed-for opportunity
  arrived. In April of this year the Austrians declared war against
  France, and on the 8th of the same month the enthusiastic patriot
  Johann Maria von Kolb appeared in the market-place of Innichen, where
  he issued written proclamations, still preserved at Bruneck, bidding
  all the parish priests and the inhabitants of the Upper Pusterthal
  instantly to rise, throw off the Bavarian yoke and join the beloved
  Austrian troops, which were now marching in that direction.</p>

  <p>Incited by Von Kolb and other leaders, the people rose and
  welcomed the Austrians. The Bavarian troops stationed at Bruneck
  hastily retreated to Brixen, and the Austrians entered the chief town
  of the Pusterthal on April 12. Peace now reigned in the district for
  several months. The rest of the Tyrol, however, was in commotion. In
  May the Bavarians were again back in the country, and the French
  coming to their assistance. The people rose under the leadership of
  the brave Hofer. They won a great victory at Iselberg, but in October
  the French had taken possession of Innsbruck, and the treaty of
  Schonbrunn immediately followed, in which the Tyrolese, again handed
  over to Bavaria, were ordered to lay down their arms.</p>

  <p>The people disobeyed: they were incredulous, believing the
  official documents to be forged; and, although he knew better, Von
  Kolb strengthened them in this belief. He, together with Peter
  Kemenater, a wealthy wirth, and George Lantschner, the priest of
  Weitenthal, urged the people to rise and fight for their country,
  setting at naught any treaty of peace. Thus, though the French troops
  were allowed by the town authorities to enter Bruneck on November 5,
  the people remained in a state of turbulence, the men of Taufers
  immediately rising and fighting the French at Gaisz, the first
  village in their valley, and although defeated and driven back, the
  neighboring peasants of Aufhofen took up the attack, having in their
  turn their village plundered and some of the inhabitants killed by
  the enemy.</p>

  <p>Von Kolb and his party next encouraged the Landsturm or people
  <i>en masse</i> to assail the French general Moreau in Brixen,
  causing his friend, General Almeras, to leave Bruneck in charge of a
  small troop and to hurry to his rescue. The very same afternoon
  (November 30) the priest Lantschner, accompanied by the wirth of
  Mühlen in the Taufersthal, Johann Hofer, marched at the head of an
  army of peasants on Bruneck. In the mean time, Almeras, prevented by
  a general uprising from reaching Brixen, turned back with his troops
  dressed as a private, and made most of the way by mountain-paths on
  foot, fearing to remain in his carriage, as immediately after
  starting his cook had been shot dead on the coach-box. Approaching
  Bruneck, the general discovered the concourse of the armed peasants
  to be far greater than he had imagined, and a whole day elapsed
  before his entry into the town could be effected. On December 2 the
  insurgents advanced nearer and nearer, pouring down from the
  neighboring village of Percha, which they had chosen as their
  head-quarters. At one o&#39;clock they pushed before them two sledges
  loaded with hay from Edelsheim, and one filled with straw from
  Percha, and, forming by this means a barricade in front of the
  Capuchin monastery, began firing, whilst troops of peasants still
  marched forward from other villages. More used to plough-shares than
  swords, however, the peasants, numbering ten thousand men, instead of
  surrounding the town, as they might easily have done, merely attacked
  it on the north side, thus enabling the French general with a handful
  of cavalry and infantry to surprise them in the rear. Confusion and a
  most ignominious defeat ensued, the peasants fleeing across the
  meadows and fields, some being killed and others taken prisoners.
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 82]</span> Although repulsed, they were not
  reduced, and animated by the rash, vindictive Von Kolb, made several
  fresh skirmishes. Standing up in the village street of Percha, this
  leader animated them still to fresh attacks, and sent special
  messengers north, south, east and west, vowing fire and vengeance to
  all who succumbed; but on December 6, fresh French troops having come
  to the aid of General Almeras, the peasants saw that their cause was
  lost and refused to listen. Thus ceased the peasant war.</p>

  <p>The town of Bruneck, which had suffered greatly from the double
  siege, still venerates the memory of General Almeras, who exerted
  himself on its behalf, whilst his liberality toward the peasants,
  whom he regarded as ignorant and misguided, was equally praiseworthy,
  mitigating in many instances the severity of the council of war.</p>

  <p>Although the insurgents were dispersed, most of the French
  officers, unlike General Almeras, condescended to the bitterest
  revenge against the disarmed people. All the leaders who had not
  concealed themselves were captured and summarily shot without trial.
  Von Kolb, however, escaped with his life: disguised as a seller of
  lemons, he fled over the Redensberg, and passing through Antholz
  managed to reach Stiermark. Another still more remarkable man, Father
  Joachim, known amongst the people as Red Beard, wading through deep
  snow managed to hide himself for many months in the castle of
  Goldrain. In August of 1810, disguised as an artisan, he reached
  Switzerland, Milan, and finally Vienna, where the emperor, as a
  reward for his valiant deeds, presented him with the living of
  Hietzing in the neighborhood of Vienna.</p>

  <p>Our long but necessary preamble now brings us to Peter Sigmair. He
  too had a price set on his head, having acted as lieutenant in the
  popular cause, and had accordingly sought a safe retreat in the
  mountains. Soon, however, a friend brought him word that his old
  father, George Sigmair, the Tharer-wirth of Mitter Olang, when
  attending to some business in Bruneck on St. Thomas&#39;s Day, had
  been arrested by command of General Broussier, with orders that he
  should be shot if his son did not give himself up before three days.
  The son might have comforted himself with the thought that it would
  be impossible for the general to put so tyrannical a threat into
  execution, but the consciousness of his father in such danger
  conquered all other feelings. He immediately started for Bruneck, and
  gave himself up. His father was instantly liberated, whilst he, bound
  in chains, was sent to Bozen, but brought back to Bruneck at the
  beginning of January, 1810, when in his cell in the castle he quietly
  heard his sentence&#8212;that he should be shot before the door of
  his father&#39;s inn at Mitter Olang, and that his body should then
  be hung on a gallows as a solemn warning to refractory peasants. His
  young wife, maddened with grief, penetrated to the presence of the
  French general, clasped his knees and plead in vain for mercy. He
  remained perfectly impassive to her entreaties, but granted a favor
  to a young priest, Franz von Mörl, who accompanied the prisoner in
  his last moments&#8212;namely, that, instead of before the window,
  the execution should take place at a small wayside chapel on the
  confines of the village. And so Peter Sigmair was shot at the age of
  thirty-six, honored for his valor, but still more for his filial
  piety.</p>

  <p>We were now standing on the very spot, before the humble,
  whitewashed chapel. Above the entrance, which was closed, a rude
  fresco, much injured by weather, commemorated the deed. Some soldiers
  in very high-waisted regimentals were taking aim at Peter Sigmair,
  who knelt blindfolded, wearing the full peasant costume, which, more
  ordinary in those days, is still used for marriages, and is
  consequently represented even now on mortuary tablets as indicative
  of the heavenly wedding-garment.</p>

  <p>After seeing the now desolate, forsaken chapel, we bent our steps
  into the village to visit the Wirth-haus. A friendly, quiet
  peasant-woman met us in the dark passage, <span class="pagenum">[pg
  83]</span> and showed us into a clean, comfortable wainscoted room,
  the <i>zechstube</i>. We ordered some wine for the good of the house,
  which was brought by an equally quiet peasant-man. Setting it on the
  table, he hovered about the room in an uncertain way, but confided to
  us eventually that he was the landlord. The woman then came and
  introduced herself as his sister, and they both stood silently before
  us in a house as silent as themselves, the great festival at the
  neighboring hamlet having probably thinned their custom. It was
  evident that they had plenty of leisure to answer any questions, and
  we had soon learned from them that the old Tharer-wirth was their
  grandfather.</p>

  <p>&quot;You must know,&quot; said the sister, &quot;I have read in
  big printed letters that Onkel Peter&#39;s little children, holding
  up their little hands, prayed the cruel general with tears to spare
  their father. It is a pity that what is put in print can never be
  altered, because he had no children. He had only a young wife, who
  afterward married a bauer at Antholz, where their son is the
  priest.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the wirth. &quot;If there had been children,
  they would have succeeded, not my mother. It was before either of us
  was born, but she often told us of it&#8212;how cold it was, in the
  depth of winter, on the Name of Jesus Day. Onkel Peter marched with a
  cross placed in his hands, which were bound behind him, from Bruneck,
  being led to a house near the inn at Nieder Olang, since burnt down,
  where he confessed. At the wayside chapel he next received the
  sacrament, and then the soldiers shot him.&quot;</p>

  <p>Were there any mementoes of him in the house? we asked.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, not now. His belt used to lie about the house, but had
  been either carried off or lost.&quot; And then one of the good souls
  intimated that it was sad to have a relation publicly executed: he
  must pass as a criminal. It did their hearts good to find that
  strangers from other parts did not look upon him as such. It was
  natural that they and the villagers should think well of him, but
  they were poor ignorant people at the best. However, criminal or not,
  all the school-children in Tyrol read about him now. He was stuck in
  their primers and called a hero and a patriot; only, even in the
  lesson-book, the mistake had again been made of giving him children.
  The wirth thought it must be for effect&#8212;to make the tale more
  thrilling.</p>

  <p>&quot;We often puzzle ourselves about the rights and wrongs of
  Onkel Peter&#39;s death,&quot; concluded the simple man; &quot;but
  this will always be clear to us, that three foreign ladies visiting
  the house out of respect to his memory speaks well for him.&quot;</p>

  <p>Thus we left the staid brother and sister quietly gratified by our
  call, and returning to Nieder Olang found the kellnerin of the now
  deserted inn awaiting us with a nosegay of stately white lilies. The
  gig too was ready, and with our dear friend E&#8212;&#8212; at our
  side we drove homeward in the silent summer evening. We passed
  Percha, a small group of peaceful houses and a church, contrasting
  forcibly with the wild, tumultuous scenes which it must have
  witnessed when the enthusiast Von Kolb and his companions convulsed
  the peasantry;&#8212;and passed over the upland plains where the ten
  thousand peasants had been repulsed and scattered&#8212;a corn-giving
  land, affluent with myriad golden shocks, like a perpetual
  Joseph&#39;s dream.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>The Hof proved too quiet and healthful a resting-place, and its
  inmates too genuinely good and honest, for us to bid it a lasting
  farewell in &#39;71. Behold us, therefore, in the following summer
  again within its friendly walls, where we at first settled down to a
  harmonious, industrious routine of several weeks: then an extreme
  desire seizing upon some of us to see more of the glories of mountain
  and valley around, we set out one and all for six days of pure
  holiday enjoyment; part of the programme being for the more
  adventurous, attended by Moidel, to climb to the Olm on a visit to
  Jakob.</p>

  <h2>WITH THE AMERICAN AMBULANCE CORPS AT PARIS.</h2>

  <p>We were sitting under the trees in the Champs Élysées, in sight of
  the ruined Tuileries, when my friend gave me the following
  reminiscences. In repeating what I can recall of them, as nearly as I
  can in his own language, I shall use names with almost as great
  freedom as he did&#8212;a fact for which I think I owe no
  apology.</p>

  <p>&quot;Restore that wreck of the Tuileries,&quot; said my
  friend&#8212;but I shall let him tell his story without
  quotation-marks, and without the interruption of my urging and
  questionings, that finally got him almost as much interested in his
  subject as I was myself&#8212;Restore that wreck of the Tuileries,
  and these gay equipages and these loiterers in the Avenue would
  repeat for you, very nearly, the scene of my first service with the
  American ambulance. That was before I was a regular member of the
  corps&#8212;in fact, before the corps which operated at the siege of
  Paris had been properly formed. Dr. Sims, Dr. Tom Pratt, Frank Hayden
  and others, with three ambulance-wagons, were going to the front: we
  heard a great deal of <i>&quot;à Berlin!&quot;</i> in the streets in
  those days. I came down this way to the Palais d&#39;Industrie to see
  them off, and when I did see the American ladies raising the colors
  to march through the crowd, I couldn&#39;t help taking part in the
  procession. So I put on the <i>brassard</i> of Geneva&#8212;a red
  cross on a white band strapped on the arm, being the ambulance badge
  established in 1864 by the International Convention of
  Geneva&#8212;and seized one of the sticks with a sack on the end of
  it, and began asking contributions for the wounded as the cortege
  moved on.</p>

  <p>It was one of the most exciting scenes I ever witnessed, our march
  for miles through the crowded boulevards to the station of the
  Northern Railway. Dr. Sims walked behind his own horses, which headed
  the procession, and the throng everywhere commented admiringly upon
  the <i>chic</i> of the fine animals. The American ladies&#8212;there
  were three of them&#8212;marched beside the wagons, bearing the
  French and American colors and the red cross of the International
  ambulance. We filled and emptied and refilled our sacks with the
  Napoleons from the <i>monde</i> in their flash barouches and from the
  loungers of the clubs, and with the greasy sous of the workingmen and
  grisettes. Many took out purses containing five sous and gave three:
  many took out purses containing silver and copper, and gave the
  silver. Old men with feeble sight and hearing would hobble up to us
  through the crowd and ask, &quot;What is this?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;For the wounded,&quot; we would say&#8212;&quot;for
  France!&quot;</p>

  <p>And trembling hands would be thrust into pockets, and
  &quot;God&#39;s blessing on you!&quot; would go with their silver or
  sous.</p>

  <p>Well, well, it was a great day. It was, I believe, the largest
  collection ever taken up in Paris for the wounded. We shouted
  ourselves hoarse when the train bore the corps away for Mézières.
  They served through the war, part of the time with the French, part
  of the time with the Prussians. Many of them have since been
  decorated by both governments.</p>

  <p>It is to Dr. Evans that the American ambulance owes more perhaps
  than to any one man. It supported itself, our corps did, and Dr.
  Evans furnished the largest portion of the money. He had some
  American ambulance-wagons and the material for a field hospital
  brought over and exhibited at the Exposition of 1867, and these were
  still in his possession. They were early offered to the American
  corps, but a misunderstanding between Dr. Evans and Dr. Sims caused
  the latter to go to the field with wagons, etc. furnished by the
  International ambulance. So we who formed the American corps at Paris
  during the siege had the use of Dr. Evans&#39;s wagons and material.
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 85]</span> The doctor himself accompanied
  the empress in her flight; but from England he sent money whenever he
  could get it into Paris, and did all in his power for the
  ambulance.</p>

  <p>Some time before the Prussians had closed in upon us it was
  ordered that the useless mouths (<i>bouches inutiles</i>) should
  leave the city. Of course thousands left. We who remained expected we
  should have to go into the ranks. I liked the excitement of the
  thing, and stayed through it all. Meanwhile, Dr. John Swinburne, who
  was formerly, I believe, a health officer of New York, had been
  invited to take charge of the American hospital at Paris. Dr.
  Evans&#39;s tents were pitched in the Avenue de l&#39;Impératrice, in
  the place where the dog-show used to be. This was our headquarters
  all through the siege, though at last, as winter came on, the tents
  were not large or comfortable enough to hold the wounded, and so we
  built barracks there. George Kidder, Will Dreyer and I joined the
  corps together. My first service was to beg Bowles Brothers&#39;
  American flag and hoist it over our tents. Then our duties consisted
  for a while in loafing about the grounds, driving tent pegs, greasing
  the wagons and drawing up rules for our own government, for there was
  no fighting just then. Those were the bright, sunny days of
  September. Montretout and Châtillon had been taken, the Zouaves had
  disgraced themselves, and we were utterly cut off from the world. We
  elected two captains. One was William B. Bowles, and the other Joseph
  K. Riggs of Washington. They were to serve on alternate days.</p>

  <p>One morning we went down in our wagons, drawn by horses belonging
  to members of our corps, and reported to the &quot;International
  Society for the Aid of the Wounded.&quot; We found them at the Palais
  d&#39;Industrie. They did not think much of us, as we could not help
  perceiving, but they finally consented to let us go out at the first
  sortie&#8212;namely, that of Villejuif, when the French tried to take
  the villages of Thiais and L&#39;Hay. We got upon the field just as
  the firing was over. The French had taken one village at the point of
  the bayonet, but at last they had retired so precipitately that they
  had left their wounded in the Prussian lines. There the poor fellows
  lay, in among the yellow wheat, with great well-fed Prussians
  prancing around them on horseback. It was a terrible scene,
  especially to me, being the first of the kind I had ever seen. But
  after a while I was so busy with the others, picking up the wounded
  and burying the dead, that somehow I lost my first overwhelming sense
  of the horror of the spectacle.</p>

  <p>We smelt our first powder&#8212;that is, a few stray balls came
  among us&#8212;at Châtillon. Returning from this latter fight, we saw
  the burning of the palace of St. Cloud. It was a beautiful October
  sunset and evening, and the sight was indescribably grand.</p>

  <p>You will, however, get a better idea of our share in a sortie if I
  tell you more particularly of the next one, that of Malmaison. It was
  there, in fact, that we began to make our reputation. This was the
  sortie fraught with most real danger to the Germans. They had not
  then had time to establish their lines, and if the attack had been
  followed up with more men, the French, it is thought, might have
  taken Versailles and cut the enemy&#39;s line of communication. As it
  was, the Prussians had everything packed and horses saddled, ready to
  leave Versailles at a moment&#39;s notice. Ur. Sarazin, chief surgeon
  of Ducrot&#39;s corps, had asked us to rendezvous at the Rond Point
  de Courbevoie, just behind Mont Valérien, where the French had a
  battery. On our way out there that beautiful October afternoon, as we
  were driving up the hill from Porte Maillot, the American flag and
  the colors of the International ambulance flying over our five
  wagons, we were met by the whole provisional government of France.
  Jules Ferry hailed us and asked a ride. They were going to see the
  fight. We took them all in: we had in our wagon Rochefort, Ferry and
  Favre; the others took seats as the wagons came up. We left them on a
  sort of platform which had been built for <span class="pagenum">[pg
  86]</span> them upon the pedestal of the famous
  knee-breeches-and-cocked-hat statue of the First Napoleon, which was
  replaced by the Roman-togaed one upon the Column Venôdme. The
  first-mentioned statue had even then been toppled over and carted
  away. We went on to the top of the hill of Courbevoie, whence,
  however, we were promptly ordered back. From our station farther in
  the rear, lying down in our wagons, we watched the bombs and the
  smoke of the musketry rising over the hill. The French were beating
  the Prussians back with great slaughter, as we heard from couriers
  constantly sent in.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Dr. Sarazin rode into our midst and shouted,
  &quot;Ambulance Américaine, en avant!&quot; Putting spurs to his
  horse, he galloped down the road, we following at a brisk trot.
  Halfway to Rueil he drew up and said, &quot;Pass that windmill, turn
  to the right, and you will be on the field.&quot; We plunged on
  through potato-patches and vineyards, our hearts in our mouths. As we
  drew past the windmill, which was on a knoll in the descent from Mont
  Valérien, we came upon the French reserves, massed by regiments
  behind the artillery and mitrailleuses which lined the crest of the
  hill we were on. Just behind them were Trochu and his staff. An
  aide-de-camp galloped toward us as we approached, and told us to take
  down our flags, shouting that we would draw fire. He had to tell us
  that only once: our flags came down like a shot. The fight was going
  on in the valley just beneath us. The sun was setting, the windows of
  Mont Valérien shimmered with its slanting rays, the green woods grew
  darker, and the blue smoke curled lazily over the combatants. Away in
  the distance the aqueduct of Marly ran in gray relief against the red
  of the evening sky. From this aqueduct, as we learned afterward, King
  William, the crown prince, Moltke and Bismarck were watching the
  struggle. Our little red-legged liners had pushed the Germans across
  the open space and were pressing them in the wood. We grew excited,
  and the boys began making for the crest of the hill among the
  artillery, when one of our party, a well-known American here in
  Paris, cried out, &quot;Gentlemen, as a clergyman and father of a
  family, I forbid you to go any farther forward and risk your
  lives.&quot; Whereupon Mr. William Bowles, aroused, but in his usual
  manner in moments of excitement&#8212;namely, with his hands in his
  vest pockets and his eyes beaming through his gold
  spectacles&#8212;observed, &quot;Gentlemen, oh that be
  d&#8212;&#8212;d! As an American and your captain, I command you to
  follow me.&quot; And we followed him, singing at the tops of our
  voices, &quot;While we were marching through Georgia.&quot;</p>

  <p>What would have become of us, carried away as we were, no one
  knows, if we had not been marched back again by higher orders. We
  were straightway sent down to the right, toward Malmaison, to gather
  the wounded. We passed Trochu and staff, who saluted us, and we wound
  down the hill, with the infantry before us, and the cannon and
  mitrailleuses behind us bellowing over our heads. The French soldiery
  sent up cheer after cheer for &quot;les Américains&quot; as we made
  our way, still shouting, &quot;While we were marching through
  Georgia.&quot; There were twenty or twenty-five of us, and we made
  some noise. In the streets of Rueil we found the dead and wounded
  very thick. We filled our wagons with the wounded, and started back
  for our hospital at Paris. In our wagon we had seven, so we had to
  walk along beside it. It was late in the night when we reached the
  city gate. There we were confronted by sentinels with glaring
  torches, challenged, asked the number of our wounded, and then
  allowed to rattle and creak over the draw-bridge. Just inside the
  walls we were met by a surging mass of anxious men, women and
  children.</p>

  <p>&quot;What regiment have you?&quot; they would shout. &quot;Has
  the Hundred-and-fifth been engaged? Have the Zouaves been
  in?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; exclaimed one from our wagon, rising on his
  elbow, &quot;they have been in, and many haven&#39;t come out
  again.&quot; Then snatching his fez from his head, <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 87]</span> he waved it in the glare of the torches, I
  and cried, &quot;Vive la France! vive la République!&quot;</p>

  <p>That poor fellow was shot in the hip. We so far cured him at the
  hospital that I saw him hobbling into the fight upon a cane, his gun
  strapped across his back, at the last sortie of the besieged. I got
  very well acquainted with him, too, at the hospital, as I did with
  many another gallant fellow on both sides. He was an educated
  gentleman of Alsace: he had entered the Zouaves as a volunteer at the
  outbreak of the war, and had fought it all through in the ranks. He
  was sergeant when he was wounded. After the war and Commune were over
  I was touched on the shoulder by some one sitting upon the seat back
  of me at the Opéra Comique one night, and there was my brave friend
  the sergeant, safe and almost sound through all.</p>

  <p>At the hospital, the night after the sortie I have just been
  telling you of, we worked with our wounded until nearly morning. Dr.
  Swinburne, I think, did not go to bed at all. And right here I ought
  to introduce you more particularly to the old doctor. Take the
  portrait of General Grant, run a good many streaks of gray through
  his hair and beard, a few more lines on his forehead and crows&#39;
  feet around his eyes, and you have an idea of the doctor&#39;s looks.
  He is a man of great energy and few words&#8212;a surgical genius and
  a great lover of horses. He could or would explain nothing. At last
  we got to calling him &quot;Old Compound Fracture,&quot; for he would
  say, when we were starting for a fight likely to be serious,
  &quot;Boys, don&#39;t mind those slightly wounded fellows&#8212;let
  the Frenchmen pick them up: just bring me along the compound
  fractures.&quot; These latter were his hobby. He fairly doted on a
  man whom ordinary surgeons would have given up in despair; and I
  believe he was the happiest man in Paris when the first patient who
  had his leg shattered in a half dozen places began hobbling about the
  camp on crutches. The soldiers got to hear of him at last. More than
  one poor fellow lying on the field grievously wounded swore he would
  be taken to no place but to the American hospital.</p>

  <p>Our next important sortie was at Champigny. That was the occasion
  when Ducrot was surely going to push through the German lines. In his
  proclamation he had announced that he would re-enter Paris victorious
  or dead. Of course he did not keep his promise. We were all to
  rendezvous at the Champs de Mars that morning at four o&#39;clock.
  About three of the same morning Mont Valérien opened fire, and then
  Issy, then Vanves, then Mont Rouge, and so the flash and roar of
  cannon went round the whole city. That was our reveille. It was cold,
  very cold, that morning, and we waited at the rendezvous a long time
  in company with the French, Italian, Swiss and other ambulance corps.
  The great Doctor Ricord was there, and some of us heard then for the
  first time that he is an American from Baltimore. Chenu, Nellaton and
  several other famous surgeons were also there, shivering with us as
  we waited and waited for the push through the lines, which never
  came. Well, when at last the fight did occur, it made plenty of work
  for our wagons. For the next two days they were constantly going to
  and fro between the field and our hospital. Everywhere we went along
  the lines now we were recognized and made way for. One night, as one
  of our wagons was trying to cross the field, it was halted with the
  question, &quot;What ambulance is that?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Is it necessary to ask?&quot; shouted a French soldier out
  of the darkness. &quot;It is the Americans&#39;, of course: they are
  everywhere.&quot;</p>

  <p>At this sortie there rode with us a little French abbé, whom some
  of the boys had picked up weeks before roaming about the outposts
  among the trenches. He had won their hearts by his utter contempt of
  fire as he prayed with and confessed everybody he could lay hands on.
  At the sortie of Châtillon he had discovered one of our corps
  bringing in to the wagons at the risk of his life a huge pumpkin. The
  abbé imagined that Americans must set great value upon pumpkins if
  they were willing to <span class="pagenum">[pg 88]</span> secure them
  at such hazard, and he described the whole incident in
  <i>L&#39;Univers</i>, the ultra-Catholic paper of Paris. In the
  course of a few days the ambulance Américaine received two or three
  polite notes from religious French maiden ladies, saying that they
  had a few pumpkins which were at the service of the gentlemen of the
  corps. We received the pumpkins, and skirmished for the ingredients
  of pumpkin-pie, which the matron of our hospital baked for us. This
  was an unknown use for pumpkins in France, and those pies cost about
  their weight in silver. Sugar we had&#8212;it was the eggs that cost.
  Horsemeat and pumpkin-pie! There was a wild extravagance in that
  dinner, but then it was patriotic&#8212;at least the dessert was.</p>

  <p>We nearly froze to death at Bourget, but I have not time to tell
  you of it. I must pass on to the last sortie&#8212;toward Montretout
  and Malmaison. That was a dark, foggy, leaden morning, with a
  drizzling rain. We passed through the whole French army on our way
  out&#8212;line, National Guards, Mobiles, artillery, cavalry: we
  passed through them all, everywhere meeting with a grateful
  reception. Sometimes they cheered us and our wagons (now increased to
  eight) and our immense coffee-pot. This last was an institution: it
  consisted of three great boilers mounted on wheels. Before the meat
  gave out we used sometimes to put soup in our coffee-pot and take it
  to the field. Coffee by some means we still had. Even on the desolate
  morning I am now telling you of many a poor foot-soldier who had been
  upon the almost impassable roads all night had been cheered by a sly
  tin cupful of the precious liquid as we trudged on toward the field.
  Well, we were finally ordered to halt at the little village of Rueil,
  within a stone&#39;s throw of the church where Josephine and Hortense
  lie buried. I climbed a hill on the left, and saw the French pushing
  toward Buzenval. They could see nothing before them but a line of
  fire&#8212;not a Prussian above the low wall in front of the thick
  mass of wood. Though I could see these Frenchmen dropping down by
  hundreds, they went steadily on and on. Some of them were National
  Guards who had never before been under fire. It was here that young
  Henri Regnault fell, with many other Parisians known in literature
  and art. After a while the Germans began shelling the hill on which I
  was, and I scampered down to the open square where the wagons were.
  It was not long, however, till another German battery got to throwing
  shells into this square, each discharge bringing them nearer and
  nearer to us. Suddenly a shell struck the corner house in front of
  us. The door opened in a very deliberate way, and out came a man in a
  blouse, smoking a pipe, and followed by a woman with a baby in her
  arms. He leisurely locked the door behind him, and put the key into
  his pocket. Then he started slowly across the square, with his wife
  and baby still behind him. As he passed us I exclaimed, &quot;For
  Heaven&#39;s sake, what are you doing here with that baby? Don&#39;t
  you see they are shelling all around us?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, I see, I see: one of them struck our house just now.
  I&#39;ve got another one up here, and we&#39;re moving to it.&quot;
  And without taking his hands out of his pockets or his pipe out of
  his mouth, he strolled on across the open square, followed by his
  wife, who seemed absorbed only in hushing the baby as it wailed in
  fright at the sound of the bursting shells.</p>

  <p>The French line was soon thrown back, and we filled our wagons
  with wounded and started for the city, the shells still falling
  unpleasantly thick and near. One of them struck right under our
  coffee-pot, and, exploding, sent it in a hundred directions. The
  horses which drew it did not happen to be hit, but they took fright
  and dashed off, wrecking what was left of the coffee-pot wagon. We
  got back to town as fast as we knew how that day. We tried to go out
  again at night, but could make no headway against the crowd of
  wagons, artillery and the retreating army on the roads. It was an
  utterly demoralized mob. We barely escaped massacre by a regiment of
  Belleville National Guards, who were <span class="pagenum">[pg
  89]</span> mad, raving mad, accusing everybody of incapacity and
  treason. The next day we went out with a burying-party, and found
  members of this same National Guard thickly strewn among the vines of
  Buzenval and Montretout, and we buried them. In their new knap-sacks
  we found crested note-paper and many such things, showing their
  owners&#39; rank and want of military experience at the same time.
  Some of these articles were stained with blood. We saw out there the
  young lady who was soon to have married Henri Regnauit. She was
  looking for his body among the dead, and found it during the day.
  Young Regnault, it is claimed, was introducing a new school in French
  painting. He had made some remarkable studies in Algiers, one of the
  results of which was the well-known picture of Salomé in the Salon of
  1870. I have said we saw his betrothed searching for his body among
  the dead; and the memory of that sweet, brave girl in that awful
  scene has lent a pathos to the story of his life and death which I do
  not get out of the writers and painters who have since dwelt so much
  and so lovingly upon the subject.</p>

  <p>George McFarland of New York and two other fellows got lost from
  our wagons the night before, when we left the field. They took refuge
  in a tomb, where half a dozen poor wounded had crawled before them.
  They remained there for three long hours, hearing the shells burst
  around them from a tremendous cross-fire of the Germans. These three
  fellows, by the by, were the unlucky men of the ambulance. Whenever,
  by any chance, any of us were missing late at night, it was always
  they. When the wagons were full, the roads dusty or covered with
  sleet, it was they too who failed to get a seat, and had to walk to
  town. When our eatables had disappeared, or we had no wine or drink
  of any kind, they were sure to come in hungry, thirsty and foot-sore
  from some distant part of the field. At Champigny they slept on a
  billiard-table; upon the Plateau d&#39;Avron they just happened
  around when the Prussians began the awful bombardment which obliged
  the French to scurry off, leaving guns and stores. This, they said,
  was their worst day out, for they half ran, half rolled down the
  hillside through a rain of shells, about a hundred guns, they
  maintained, having been concentrated upon that particular plateau. At
  Rueil one of them was just coming up to get a cup of coffee when the
  shell struck our coffee-pot. I witnessed the escape that time, and it
  did truly seem miraculous.</p>

  <p>I think I may state it as a fact that if it had not been for the
  loss of that coffee-pot we should never have eaten the cook&#39;s
  dog. It came about in this natural&#8212;or perhaps I should say
  unnatural&#8212;way. In the early days of the siege, you see, some
  poor wretch who lived near our hospital possessed, as is almost
  always the case with a Frenchman removed a quarter of a degree, say,
  above abject poverty, a favorite dog. One day his beast and house
  were made glad by the appearance of two pups. They were tawny,
  bright-eyed little fellows, and the Frenchman loved them with a love
  that the Anglo-Saxon knows not of, especially in the matter of dogs.
  Well, provisions got scarcer and scarcer, and finally, with an
  anguish that I have no right to ridicule, and as the only thing left
  for him to do, the poor Frenchman brought his pups around and
  presented them to the cook of our hospital. Here the little fellows
  waxed fat and strong, and were soon great favorites, not only of the
  good-natured cook, but of all the fellows of the ambulance. Perhaps
  you never saw a pot of horse-soup boiling: if you have, you will
  never forget the great blotches of fat that float upon the surface of
  it. Many skimmings of this did John Cook, as we used to call our
  <i>chef</i>, put aside for the pups. In the course of time, however,
  famine began to invade the ambulance. The canned meat and the hams
  had long since disappeared; a horse belonging to one of our corps,
  found overtaken by mysterious death in his stall, had been devoured;
  but the two pups, fat and tender, no one ventured to attack. And they
  had the powerful protection of the cook. Still, it made our mouths
  water to see <span class="pagenum">[pg 90]</span> them gambol in
  their sleekness. At length came the memorable morning of the last
  sortie at Montretout. Then for the first time we mounted the cook
  upon our coffee-pot wagon, with an extra large <i>brassard</i> around
  his arm, allowing him about three times the ordinary amount of linen
  to show how peacefully and culinarily he was neutral. Poor fellow! I
  am sorry to say he was soon demoralized that day. The coffee he had
  brewed was a success, but he could not stand Krupp shells. Long
  before one of them had exploded under his coffee-pot he had wanted to
  go home. At that fearful moment he completely lost his head
  and&#8212;his white cap. How he got back to the hospital not even
  himself ever knew. It was long after nightfall when he wandered in,
  weary, listless, sorrowful. One of the pups came up to greet him as
  he crossed the threshold of the kitchen. The <i>chef</i> met that
  welcome with an unfeeling kick, he was so demoralized. The fate of
  the pup was sealed. Scarce had the cook found his way to a bed in one
  of the tents when the scullions made for the pup, and had his fat
  frizzing on the gridiron and his bones dancing in a seething
  soup-pot. We all had a feast that night. Even the cook himself had a
  greasy morsel brought to his bedside. But somehow thenceforth the
  name of that dog was never mentioned, and his brother led a more
  luxurious, a sleeker life than ever. We had learned, I think, the old
  moral of being moved by sorrow for the dead to be kinder to the
  living.</p>

  <p>As I have said before, we became very well acquainted with many of
  the wounded men at our hospital. With some, indeed, we contracted
  strong friendships. We buried many by subscription, thus rescuing
  them from the <i>fosse commune</i> to which soldiers, French or
  German, were as a rule consigned within the French lines. Among
  others was a fair-haired Saxon by the name of Bruno, almost a boy in
  years, who was brought in from Champigny. He won our hearts from the
  very first by asking that a suffering Frenchman who lay beside him
  might have his wounds dressed before his own. He was dangerously and
  painfully wounded himself, yet no one ever heard him complain. I
  shall never hear the &quot;Wacht am Rhein&quot; without thinking of
  him, for he was the first one that I ever heard sing it. He sang it
  to me one night in return for some old German songs I had tried to
  cheer him with; that is, he sang some of it: his voice was so feeble
  that I had to stop him. He seemed to expect death, and was prepared
  for it. His long, wavy blonde hair and his beardless boy face were
  always beautiful, but imagine them when his blue eyes were lit up by
  the sentiment of that song!</p>

  <p>The next night, when I came to visit Bruno, a French National
  Guard was dying not far from him, with wife and family kneeling
  around the bed. The tent was hushed, and I hesitated a moment at the
  door. One or two American ladies, volunteer nurses of the ambulance,
  were grouped near the dying man back of the family. Suddenly,
  Lisette, an Alsatian nurse who worked devotedly night and day for
  friend or foe alike, and who in her neat white cap had been standing
  in a corner wiping her eyes, approached me and said in her broad
  German French, <i>&quot;Partonn</i>, but I will pray for this poor
  unfortunate.&quot; And she dropped on her knees beside the bed and
  commenced aloud in German a simple, earnest, honest prayer to which
  the scene and the language gave an effect utterly indescribable.
  There were few dry eyes in the tent. Soon after that I could tell by
  the movements about the bed that the poor National Guard was dead. I
  turned to the bedside of the wounded Saxon, and found his hands
  clasped upon his breast and his lips muttering a prayer for his
  enemy.</p>

  <p>It was near Christmas then, and to cheer Bruno after the foregoing
  scene I spoke to him of the merry Christmas-times in the Fatherland.
  He shook his head mournfully: &quot;Ach Gott! die werd&#39; ich nie
  wiedersehen&quot; (&quot;I shall never see them again&quot;). The
  only thing which he seemed very much to regret was that he should not
  live long enough to get the cross he had won, so that it might be
  sent to his father at his little <span class="pagenum">[pg 91]</span>
  village on the Elbe. Well, the next afternoon we were gathered in the
  same mournful and hushed way about his bedside. The dying Saxon alone
  broke the silence. There is no way of reproducing in English the
  wonderful pathos of his speech, mellow even in its faintness. I
  suppose I ought to say that his mind was wandering, but at the time
  it did not seem so to me. He spoke first of the green fields
  approaching his native village, then of the flowers; and then finally
  he exclaimed, &quot;There gleams the Elbe, and there comes
  father!&#8212;Father!&quot; And in the joy of that meeting, real or
  imaginary, a smile parting his lips, he died.</p>

  <p>We gave the gentle Saxon the poor honor of a separate grave, and
  as soon after the siege as I could get a letter out I wrote to his
  father, sending the few little trinkets that had been trusted to my
  keeping. In the answer and thanks of the lonely old man&#8212;for he
  was now widowed and childless&#8212;there was something almost as sad
  as the death I have been telling you of. He could not hear enough of
  his son&#39;s last days, and our correspondence ceased only when my
  minutest details had been given.</p>

  <p>I have already told you of our last sortie, and really of our last
  service as a corps. A few days after the loss of our coffee-pot the
  armistice was declared. Those were sad times. I can&#39;t tell you of
  the despair of that whole city. It makes me dizzy even to remember
  it. When the people saw that their endurance, suffering, starvation
  for those long months had been unavailing, there were no bounds to
  their speech or acts. The two words, &quot;Treason!&quot; and
  &quot;Bread!&quot; were heard everywhere. Men wept like children.
  Many actually lay down and died, half starved, half heartbroken.
  These things will never be written up&#8212;they never can be written
  up. It needed hope with the scant food so many had lived on. The city
  at the mercy of the conquerors&#8212;But there is no use in trying to
  recall those wild, miserable days. The air was charged with the
  common despair. I saw the burning of the Tuileries and all the
  horrors of the Commune, but nothing ever had such an effect upon me
  as that.</p>

  <p>I must, however, before I draw these reminiscences to a close,
  tell you about Major O&#39;Flynn, of Her Majesty&#39;s Indian army.
  It was he who brought the pumpkin into camp at Châtillon. That he
  should have risked his life most recklessly in doing it was nothing
  odd, as you will soon learn. It was only a little droll that he
  should have taken just that time and place to gratify his curiosity.
  He had heard Americans talk a great deal about pumpkin-pies, and he
  wanted to know if they were as good as their reputation; so he took
  the first chance and the first pumpkin that came in his way. Major
  Thomas Vincent O&#39;Flynn, of Her Majesty&#39;s Indian army, was of
  course an Irishman. He was tall, tawny, impassive as any Englishman;
  modest and mild-mannered in camp, and in the field utterly
  unconscious of bullets or shell. He had married a Hindoo lady, whom
  we called the Begum. She was just as excitable as he was impassive.
  He owned a pair of splendid black horses, which he generally drove
  himself in one of our wagons. Sometimes, however, he rode, as
  <i>estafette</i> or orderly, a splendid sorrel stallion, also his
  property; and this stallion, &quot;Garryowen&quot; by name, was the
  pride and delight of our hearts, the pet of our camp. The major had a
  poodle dog too, distinct from the Begum&#39;s. It was generosity
  rather than effeminacy on his part to have this dog, for he bought it
  to save its life: the former owners were about to eat it when the
  major came to the rescue. The dog was white, and our Indian warrior
  used to spend much time washing it on the eve of a fight. The dog
  would ride stretched across its master&#39;s feet on the front of the
  wagon; and upon the field, if the major was capable of the sense of
  fear&#8212;which-I doubt&#8212;it was exercised solely for his horses
  and dog. When away from these he was always getting to the front. The
  only provision he made against any possible danger was to fill his
  pocket with silver five-franc pieces. A man didn&#39;t know, he said,
  when he might be taken prisoner by <span class="pagenum">[pg
  92]</span> those &quot;thaves&quot; of Prussians, and he&#39;d better
  have his money with him till he could get his remittances from across
  the Channel. He had enough of living upon next to nothing&#8212;which
  was horse-flesh&#8212;and he didn&#39;t want to live on nothing among
  the Germans. Those five-franc pieces, however, he always put to the
  drollest uses. He would find his way in among the artillerymen, and,
  pointing to a given spot, he would tell them in the worst imaginable
  French to throw a shell in there: &quot;Ploo haut, ploo haut, mon
  bong ami: aim at the chimney, the chimney.&quot; Then he would step
  aside, with hands in his pockets, and watch results. If it was a good
  shot, he would give the gunner a five-franc piece. Thus he would pass
  along the line until he had exhausted the money with which he had
  fortified himself against starvation among the Prussians. And this
  was all for pure love of fighting, for the major saw so much of the
  French officers&#39; incompetency that he soon had precious little
  sympathy for their cause.</p>

  <p>At the second assault on Bourget, O&#39;Flynn grew tired of
  waiting for the attack, and, what is more, terribly hungry.
  &quot;I&#39;ve lived long enough on horse-mate,&quot; exclaimed the
  major, &quot;especially when I&#39;ve none of it at all!&quot; So he
  unhitched one of his black horses from the ambulance-wagon, and,
  taking a saddle from an orderly, tore off his <i>brassard</i> and
  other ambulance insignia, threw away his cap, so as not to compromise
  us, and rode bareheaded down to the very frontest of the front. The
  advance were lying crouched down in the rifle-pits, awaiting the
  signal to storm the village. Motioning to the amazed soldiery, he
  cried, still in his horrible French, &quot;Now or never! <i>Voilà</i>
  Bourget! Follow me! See, there&#39;s Bourget. Sooivez moi!&quot; All
  this to the rattle of German musketry. Seeing that he got no response
  in one place, he rode madly to the other rifle-pits and repeated the
  invitation, the officers shouting to him as he passed that he was
  riding into certain death, and conjuring him to save himself. But the
  major could not or would not understand them. Finally, some officers
  ran out, and, taking him forcibly from his horse, led him away.</p>

  <p>The major often went on commissions from our camp on the Avenue de
  l&#39;Impératrice down into the city. In those days many of the young
  French swells, to keep from going into the field, had donned the
  ambulance uniform and passed their time loafing about the cafés in
  the Boulevards. This became so great a scandal that Trochu was
  obliged to issue an order forbidding the uniform to be worn except on
  active duty. One day, as the major, bound on some errand in the
  interest of a Frenchman lying wounded in our hospital, was
  majestically riding his superb stallion Garryowen down the Champs
  Élysées, his long tawny side-whiskers waving gently in the breeze,
  his wiry frame erect as a ramrod, the blue regulation-coat buttoned
  close to his throat with American buttons, the International
  <i>brassard</i> on his arm and the ambulance shield on his
  cap,&#8212;as the major, I say, sailed down in this state, he was
  hailed by one of the chiefs of the French ambulance, which just then
  was all powerful in Paris. The major pulled up Garryowen leisurely,
  and the little Frenchman, who spoke tolerable English, demanded
  brusquely, &quot;Don&#39;t you know General Trochu has forbidden to
  wear ambulance uniform when off duty? And we want this thing
  stopped.&quot;</p>

  <p>The major very deliberately leaned over and caught the little
  French official by the button of the coat, and in an undertone asked,
  &quot;And, sure, who are you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am Mr. So-and-so,&quot; mentioning the name of one of the
  chiefs of the French International corps.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, ye are, are ye?&quot; rejoined the major, retaining his
  hold of the little man&#39;s button. &quot;Then, Mr. So-and-so, give
  my compliments&#8212;Major O&#39;Flynn&#39;s compliments, if ye loike
  it better&#8212;to General Trochu, and tell him, if you plase, that
  the gentlemen of the American ambulance and meself buy our own
  clothes and pay for them, ride our own horses and fade them; and when
  we want or have time to parade aither the one or the other, we will
  ask permission from the general himself.&quot;</p><span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 93]</span>

  <p>Releasing his hold of the Frenchman&#39;s button, the major
  saluted and rode gracefully away upon his errand of mercy. &#39;And
  after this specimen of his politeness none of us was ever interfered
  with.</p>

  <p>I have heard from others that the major and the Begum are still
  alive and thriving. One day in the times of the Commune I had crept
  up behind the Arc de Triomphe, during a lull in the fire, to take a
  look at the Communist batteries at Porte Maillot. Now, the major
  lived halfway between the Arc and the batteries. Suddenly from my
  concealment I saw the gateway of his house open, and the major sally
  forth on Garryowen. He gave merely a glance at the batteries, and
  slowly rode up toward the Arc. There was not a soul else visible on
  the highway, and it must have been he who drew the attention of the
  Versaillais, for their guns opened at once and the shells came
  spinning around in the neighborhood. Garryowen, the grand, the
  beautiful, was as accustomed to fire as his rider was: neither was
  shaken from his equilibrium. With the same easy pace they gradually
  wound their way up to and around the Arc de Triomphe, and thus calmly
  down the Champs Élysées. The droll, gallant fellow waved me a
  graceful good-day as he passed me peeping from behind my
  hiding-place; and that was my last sight, and a characteristic one,
  of Major Thomas Vincent O&#39;Flynn, of Her Majesty&#39;s Indian
  army.</p>

  <h2>A PRINCESS OF THULE.</h2>

  <h3>By William Black, Author of &quot;THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF A
  PHAETON.&quot;</h3><a name="thulechx" id="thulechx">
  <!-- H2 anchor --></a>

  <h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

  <h3>FAIRY-LAND.</h3>

  <p>&quot;Welcome to London&#8212;!&quot;</p>

  <p>He was about to add &quot;Sheila,&quot; but suddenly stopped. The
  girl, who had hastily come forward to meet him with a glad look in
  her eyes and with both hands outstretched, doubtless perceived the
  brief embarrassment of the moment, and was perhaps a little amused by
  it. But she took no notice of it: she merely advanced to him and
  caught both his hands, and said, &quot;And are you very
  well?&quot;</p>

  <p>It was the old and familiar salutation, uttered in the same odd,
  gentle, insinuating fashion, and in the same low and sweet voice.
  Sheila&#39;s stay in Oban and the few days she had already spent in
  London had not taught her the difference between &quot;very&quot; and
  &quot;ferry.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is so strange to hear you speak in London&#8212;Mrs.
  Lavender,&quot; he said, with rather a wry face as he pronounced her
  full and proper title.</p>

  <p>And now it was Sheila&#39;s turn to look a bit embarrassed and
  color, and appear uncertain whether to be vexed or pleased, when her
  husband himself broke in in his usual impetuous fashion: &quot;I say,
  Ingram, don&#39;t be a fool! Of course you must call her
  Sheila&#8212;unless when there are people here, and then you must
  please yourself. Why, the poor girl has enough of strange things and
  names about her already. I don&#39;t know how she keeps her head. It
  would bewilder me, I know; but I can see that, after she has stood at
  the window for a time, and begun to get dazed by all the wonderful
  sights and sounds outside, she suddenly withdraws and fixes all her
  attention on some little domestic duty, just as if she were hanging
  on to the practical things of life to assure herself it isn&#39;t all
  a dream. Isn&#39;t that so, Sheila?&quot; he said, putting his hand
  on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>&quot;You ought not to watch me like that,&quot; she said with a
  smile. &quot;But it is the noise that is most bewildering. There are
  many places I will know already when I see them, many places and
  things I have known in pictures; but now the size of them, and the
  noise of carriages, and the people always passing, and always
  different, always strangers, so that you never see the same people
  any more&#8212;But I am getting very much accustomed to it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You are trying very hard to get accustomed to it, any way,
  my good girl,&quot; said her husband.</p>

  <p>&quot;You need not be in a hurry: you may begin to regret some day
  that you have not a little of that feeling of wonder left,&quot; said
  Ingram. &quot;But you have not told me anything of what you think
  about London, and of how you like it, and how you like your house,
  and what you have done with Bras, and a thousand other
  things.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I will tell you all that directly, when I have got for you
  some wine and some biscuits.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Sheila, you can ring for them,&quot; said her husband, but
  she had by that time departed on her mission. Presently she returned,
  and waited upon Ingram just as if she had been in her father&#39;s
  house in Borva, with the gentlemen in a hurry to go out to the
  fishing, and herself the only one who could serve them.</p>

  <p>She put a small table close by the French window; she drew back
  the curtains as far as they would go, to show the sunshine of a
  bright forenoon in May lighting up the trees in the square and
  gleaming on the pale and tall fronts of the houses beyond; and she
  wheeled in three low easy-chairs, so as to front this comparatively
  cheerful prospect.</p>

  <p>Somehow or other, it seemed quite natural that Sheila should wheel
  in those chairs. It was certainly no disrespect on the part of either
  her husband or her visitor which caused both <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 95]</span> of them to sit still and give her her own
  way about such things. Indeed, Lavender had not as yet ever attempted
  to impress upon Sheila the necessity of cultivating the art of
  helplessness. That, with other social graces, would perhaps come in
  good time. She would soon acquire the habits and ways of her friends
  and acquaintances, without his trying to force upon her a series of
  affectations, which would only embarrass her and cloud the perfect
  frankness and spontaneity of her nature. Of one thing he was quite
  assured&#8212;that whatever mistakes Sheila might make in society
  they would never render her ridiculous. Strangers might not know the
  absolute sincerity of her every word and act, which gave her a
  courage that had no fear of criticism, but they could at least see
  the simple grace and dignity of the girl, and that natural ease of
  manner which is beyond the reach of cultivation, being mainly the
  result of a thorough consciousness of honesty. To burden her with
  rules and regulations of conduct would be to produce the very
  catastrophes he wished to avoid. Where no attempt is made, failure is
  impossible; and he was meanwhile well content that Sheila should
  simply appear as Sheila, even although she might draw in a chair for
  a guest or so far forget her dignity as to pour out some wine for her
  husband.</p>

  <p>&quot;After all, Sheila,&quot; said Lavender, &quot;hadn&#39;t I
  better begin and tell Ingram about your surprise and delight when you
  came near Oban and saw the tall hotels and the trees? It was the
  trees, I think, that struck you most, because, you know, those in
  Lewis&#8212;well, to tell the truth&#8212;the fact is, the trees of
  Lewis&#8212;as I was saying, the trees of Lewis are not
  just&#8212;they cannot be said to be&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You bad boy, to say anything against the Lewis!&quot;
  exclaimed Sheila; and Ingram held that she was right, and that there
  were certain sorts of ingratitude more disgraceful than others, and
  that this was just about the worst.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, I have brought all the good away from Lewis,&quot; said
  Lavender with a careless impertinence.</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Sheila proudly. &quot;You have not brought
  away my papa, and there is not any one in this country I have seen as
  good as he is.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear, your experience of the thirty millions of folks in
  these islands is quite convincing. I was wholly in the wrong; and if
  you forgive me we shall celebrate our reconciliation in a
  cigarette&#8212;that is to say, Ingram and I will perform the rites,
  and you can look on.&quot;</p>

  <p>So Sheila went away to get the cigarettes also.</p>

  <p>&quot;You don&#39;t say you smoke in your drawing-room,
  Lavender?&quot; said Ingram, mindful of the fastidious ways of his
  friend even when he had bachelor&#39;s rooms in King street.</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t I, though? I smoke everywhere&#8212;all over the
  place. Don&#39;t you see, we have no visitors yet. No one is supposed
  to know we have come South. Sheila must get all sorts of things
  before she can be introduced to my friends and my aunt&#39;s friends,
  and the house must be put to rights, too. You wouldn&#39;t have her
  go to see my aunt in that sailor&#39;s costume she used to rush about
  in up in Lewis?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That is precisely what I would have,&quot; said Ingram:
  &quot;she cannot look more handsome in any other dress.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, my aunt would fancy I had married a savage: I believe
  she fears something of the sort now.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And you haven&#39;t told even her that you are in
  London?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, Lavender, that is a precious silly performance.
  Suppose she hears of your being in town, what will you say to
  her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I should tell her I wanted a few days to get my wife
  properly dressed before taking her about.&quot;</p>

  <p>Ingram shrugged his shoulders: &quot;Perhaps you are right.
  Perhaps, indeed, it would be better if you waited six months before
  you introduced Sheila to your friends. At present you seem to be
  keeping the footlights turned down until everything is ready for the
  first scene, and then Sheila is to burst upon society in a blaze of
  light and color. Well, that <span class="pagenum">[pg 96]</span> is
  harmless enough; but look here! You don&#39;t know much about her
  yet: you will be mainly anxious to hear what the audience, as it
  were, say of her; and there is just a chance of your adopting their
  impressions and opinions of Sheila, seeing that you have no very
  fixed ones of your own. Now, what your social circle may think about
  her is a difficult thing to decide; and I confess I would rather have
  seen you remain six months in Lewis before bringing her up
  here.&quot;</p>

  <p>Ingram was at least a candid friend. It was not the first nor the
  hundredth time that Frank Lavender had to endure small lectures,
  uttered in a slow, deliberate voice, and yet with an indifference of
  manner which showed that Ingram cared very little how sharply his
  words struck home. He rarely even apologized for his bluntness. These
  were his opinions: Lavender could take them or leave them, as he
  liked. And the younger man, after finding his face flush a bit on
  being accused of wishing to make a dramatic impression with
  Sheila&#39;s entrance into London society, laughed in an embarrassed
  way, and said, &quot;It is impossible to be angry with you, Ingram,
  and yet you do talk so absurdly. I wonder who is likely to know more
  about the character of a girl than her own husband?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You may in time: you don&#39;t now,&quot; said Ingram,
  carefully balancing a biscuit on the point of his finger.</p>

  <p>&quot;The fact is,&quot; said Lavender with good-natured
  impatience, &quot;you are the most romantic card I know, and there is
  no pleasing you. You have all sorts of exalted notions about
  things&#8212;about sentiments and duties, and so forth. Well, all
  that is true enough, and would be right enough if the world were
  filled with men and women like yourself; but then it isn&#39;t, you
  see, and one has to give in to conventionalities of dress and living
  and ceremonies, if one wants to retain one&#39;s friends. Now, I like
  to see you going about with that wide-awake&#8212;it suits your brown
  complexion and beard&#8212;and that stick that would do for herding
  sheep; and the costume looks well and is business-like and excellent
  when you&#39;re off for a walk over the Surrey downs or lying on the
  river-banks about Henley or Cookham; but it isn&#39;t, you know, the
  sort of costume for a stroll in the Park.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Whenever God withdraws from me my small share of common
  sense,&quot; said Ingram slowly, &quot;so far that I shall begin to
  think of having my clothes made for the purpose of walking in Hyde
  Park, well&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But don&#39;t you see,&quot; said Lavender, &quot;that one
  must meet one&#39;s friends, especially when one is married; and when
  you know that at a certain hour in the forenoon they are all to be
  found in a particular place, and that a very pleasant place, and that
  you will do yourself good by having a walk in the fresh air, and so
  forth, I really don&#39;t see anything very immoral in going down for
  an hour or so to the Park!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t you think the pleasure of seeing one&#39;s friends
  might be postponed till one had done some sort of good day&#39;s
  work?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;There now!&quot; cried Lavender, &quot;that is another of
  your delusions. You are always against superstitions, and yet you
  make work a fetish. You do with work just as women do with duty: they
  carry about with them a convenient little god, and they are always
  worshiping it with small sacrifices, and complimenting themselves on
  a series of little martyrdoms that are of no good to anybody. Of
  course, duty wouldn&#39;t be duty if it wasn&#39;t disagreeable, and
  when they go nursing the sick&#8212;and they could get it better done
  for fifteen shillings a week by somebody else&#8212;they don&#39;t
  mind coming back to their families with the seeds of typhus about
  their gowns; and when they crush the affections in order to worship
  at the shrine of duty, they don&#39;t consider that they may be
  making martyr of other folks, who don&#39;t want martyrdom and get no
  sort of pleasure out of it. Now, what in all the world is the good of
  work as work? I believe that work is an unmistakable evil, but when
  it is a necessity I suppose you get some sort of selfish satisfaction
  in over-coming it; and doubtless if there was <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 97]</span> any immediate necessity in my case&#8212;I
  don&#39;t deny the necessity may arise, and that I should like
  nothing better than to work for Sheila&#39;s sake&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Now you are coming to the point,&quot; said Ingram, who had
  been listening with his usual patience to his friend&#39;s somewhat
  chaotic speculations. &quot;Perhaps you may have to work for your
  wife&#39;s sake and your own; and I confess I am surprised to see you
  so content with your present circumstances. If your aunt&#39;s
  property legally reverted to you, if you had any sort of family claim
  on it, that would make some little difference; but you know that any
  sudden quarrel between you might leave you penniless
  to-morrow.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In which case I should begin to work to-morrow, and I should
  come to you for my first commission.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And you shouldn&#39;t have it. I would leave you to go and
  fight the world for yourself; without which a man knows nothing of
  himself or of his relations with those around him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Frank, dear, here are the cigarettes,&quot; said Sheila at
  this point; and as she came and sat down the discussion ceased.</p>

  <p>For Sheila began to tell her friend of all the strange adventures
  that had befallen her since she left the far island of
  Lewis&#8212;how she had seen with fear the great mountains of Skye
  lit up by the wild glare of a stormy sunrise; how she had seen with
  astonishment the great fir-woods of Armadale; and how green and
  beautiful were the shores of the Sound of Mull. And then Oban, with
  its shining houses, its blue bay and its magnificent trees, all lit
  up by a fair and still sunshine! She had not imagined there was
  anywhere in the world so beautiful a place, and could scarcely
  believe that London itself was more rich and noble and impressive;
  for there were beautiful ladies walking along the broad pavements,
  and there were shops with large windows that seemed to contain
  everything that the mind could desire, and there was a whole fleet of
  yachts in the bay. But it was the trees, above all, that captivated
  her; and she asked if they were lords who owned those beautiful
  houses built up on the hill and half smothered among lilacs and ash
  trees and rowan trees and ivy.</p>

  <p>&quot;My darling,&quot; Lavender had said to her, &quot;if your
  papa were to come and live here, he could buy half a dozen of those
  cottages, gardens and all. They are mostly the property of well-to-do
  shopkeepers. If this little place takes your fancy, what will you say
  when you go South&#8212;when you see Wimbledon and Richmond and Kew,
  with their grand old commons and trees? Why, you could hide Oban in a
  corner of Richmond Park!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And my papa has seen all those places?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes. Don&#39;t you think it strange he should have seen them
  all, and known he could live in any one of them, and then gone away
  back to Borva?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But what would the poor people have done if he had never
  gone back?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, some one else would have taken his place.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And then, if he were living here or in London, he might have
  got tired, and he might have wished to go back to the Lewis and see
  all the people he knew; and then he would come among them like a
  stranger, and have no house to go to.&quot;</p>

  <p>Then Lavender said, quite gently, &quot;Do you think, Sheila, you
  will ever tire of living in the South?&quot;</p>

  <p>The girl looked up quickly, and said, with a sort of surprised
  questioning in her eyes, &quot;No, not with you. But then we shall
  often go to the Lewis?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; her husband said, &quot;as often as we can
  conveniently. But it will take some time at first, you know, before
  you get to know all my friends who are to be your friends, and before
  you get properly fitted into our social circle. That will take you a
  long time, Sheila, and you may have many annoyances or embarrassments
  to encounter; but you won&#39;t be very much afraid, my
  girl?&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila merely looked up to him: there was no fear in the frank,
  brave eyes.</p>

  <p>The first large town she saw struck a cold chill to her heart. On
  a wet and <span class="pagenum">[pg 98]</span> dismal afternoon they
  sailed into Greenock. A heavy smoke hung about the black
  building-yards and the dirty quays; the narrow and squalid streets
  were filled with mud, and only the poorer sections of the population
  waded through the mire or hung disconsolately about the corners of
  the thoroughfares. A gloomier picture could not well be conceived;
  and Sheila, chilled with the long and wet sail and bewildered by the
  noise and bustle of the harbor, was driven to the hotel with a sore
  heart and a downcast face.</p>

  <p>&quot;This is not like London, Frank?&quot; she said, pretty
  nearly ready to cry with disappointment.</p>

  <p>&quot;This? No. Well, it is like a part of London, certainly, but
  not the part you will live in.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But how can we live in the one place without passing the
  other and being made miserable by it? There was no part of Oban like
  this.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, you will live miles away from the docks and quays of
  London. You might live for a lifetime in London without ever knowing
  it had a harbor. Don&#39;t you be afraid, Sheila. You will live in a
  district where there are far finer houses than any you saw in Oban,
  and far finer trees; and within a few minutes&#39; walk you will find
  great gardens and parks, with lakes in them and wild-fowl, and you
  will be able to teach the boys about how to set the helm and the
  sails when they are launching their small boats.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I should like that,&quot; said Sheila, with her face
  brightening.</p>

  <p>&quot;Perhaps you would like a boat yourself?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said frankly. &quot;If there were not many
  people there, we might go out sometimes in the
  evening&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>Her husband laughed and took her hand: &quot;You don&#39;t
  understand, Sheila. The boats the boys have are little things a foot
  or two long&#8212;like the one in your papa&#39;s bed-room in Borva.
  But many of the boys would be greatly obliged to you if you would
  teach them how to manage the sails properly, for sometimes dreadful
  shipwrecks occur.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You must bring them to our house. I am very fond of little
  boys, when they begin to forget to be shy, and let you become
  acquainted with them.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Lavender, &quot;I don&#39;t know many of
  the boys who sail boats in the Serpentine: you will have to make
  their acquaintance yourself. But I know one boy whom I must bring to
  the house. He is a German-Jew boy, who is going to be another
  Mendelssohn, his friends say. He is a pretty boy, with ruddy-brown
  hair, big black eyes and a fine forehead; and he really sings and
  plays delightfully. But you know, Sheila, you must not treat him as a
  boy, for he is over fourteen, I should think; and if you were to kiss
  him&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He might be angry,&quot; said Sheila with perfect
  simplicity.</p>

  <p>&quot;I might,&quot; said Lavender; and then, noticing that she
  seemed a little surprised, he merely patted her head and bade her go
  and get ready for dinner.</p>

  <p>Then came the great climax of Sheila&#39;s southward
  journey&#8212;her arrival in London. She was all anxiety to see her
  future home; and, as luck would have it, there was a fair spring
  morning shining over the city. For a couple of hours before she had
  sat and looked out of the carriage-window as the train whirled
  rapidly through the scarcely-awakened country, and she had seen the
  soft and beautiful landscapes of the South lit up by the early
  sunlight. How the bright little villages shone, with here and there a
  gilt weathercock glittering on the spire of some small gray church,
  while as yet in many valleys a pale gray mist lay along the bed of
  the level streams or clung to the dense woods on the upland heights!
  Which was the more beautiful&#8212;the sharp, clear picture, with its
  brilliant colors and its awakening life, or the more mystic landscape
  over which was still drawn the tender veil of the morning haze? She
  could not tell. She only knew that England, as she then saw it,
  seemed a great country that was very beautiful, that had few
  inhabitants, and that was still and sleepy, and bathed in sunshine.
  How happy must the people be who lived in those quiet green valleys
  by the side of slow and smooth <span class="pagenum">[pg 99]</span>
  rivers, and amid great woods and avenues of stately trees, the like
  of which she had not imagined even in her dreams!</p>

  <p>But from the moment that they got out at Euston Square she seemed
  a trifle bewildered, and could only do implicitly as her husband bade
  her&#8212;clinging to his hand, for the most part, as if to make sure
  of guidance. She did indeed glance somewhat nervously at the hansom
  into which Lavender put her, apparently asking how such a tall and
  narrow two-wheeled vehicle could be prevented toppling over. But when
  he, having sent on all their luggage by a respectable old
  four-wheeler, got into the hansom beside her, and put his hand inside
  her arm, and bade her be of good cheer that she should have such a
  pleasant morning to welcome her to London, she said &quot;Yes&quot;
  mechanically, and only looked out in a wistful fashion at the great
  houses and trees of Euston Square, the mighty and roaring stream of
  omnibuses, the droves of strangers, mostly clad in black, as if they
  were going to church, and the pale blue smoke that seemed to mix with
  the sunshine and make it cold and distant.</p>

  <p>They were in no hurry, these two, on that still morning, and so,
  to impress Sheila all at once with a sense of the greatness and
  grandeur of London, he made the cabman cut down by Park Crescent and
  Portland Place to Regent Circus. Then they went along Oxford street;
  and there were crowded omnibuses taking young men into the city,
  while all the pavements were busy with hurrying passers-by. What
  multitudes of unknown faces, unknown to her and unknown to each
  other! These people did not speak: they only hurried on, each intent
  upon his own affairs, caring nothing, apparently, for the din around
  them, and looking so strange and sad in their black clothes in the
  pale and misty sunlight.</p>

  <p>&quot;You are in a trance, Sheila,&quot; he said.</p>

  <p>She did not answer. Surely she had wandered into some magical
  city, for now the houses on one side of the way suddenly ceased, and
  she saw before her a great and undulating extent of green, with a
  border of beautiful flowers, and with groups of trees that met the
  sky all along the southern horizon. Did the green and beautiful
  country she had seen shoot in thus into the heart of the town, or was
  there another city far away on the other side of the trees? The place
  was almost as deserted as those still valleys she had passed by in
  the morning. Here, in the street, there was the roar of a passing
  crowd, but there was a long and almost deserted stretch of park, with
  winding roads and umbrageous trees, on which the wan sunlight fell
  from between loose masses of half-golden cloud.</p>

  <p>Then they passed Kensington Gardens, and there were more people
  walking down the broad highways between the elms.</p>

  <p>&quot;You are getting nearly home now, Sheila,&quot; he said.
  &quot;And you will be able to come and walk in these avenues whenever
  you please.&quot;</p>

  <p>Was this, then, her home?&#8212;this section of a barrack-row of
  dwellings, all alike in steps, pillars, doors and windows? When she
  got inside the servant who had opened the door bobbed a curtsey to
  her: should she shake hands with her and say, &quot;And are you ferry
  well?&quot; But at this moment Lavender came running up the steps,
  playfully hurried her into the house and up the stairs, and led her
  into her own drawing-room. &quot;Well, darling, what do you think of
  your home, now that you see it?&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila looked round timidly. It was not a big room, but it was a
  palace in height and grandeur and color compared with that little
  museum in Borva in which Sheila&#39;s piano stood. It was all so
  strange and beautiful&#8212;the split pomegranates and quaint leaves
  on the upper part of the walls, and underneath a dull slate color
  where the pictures hung; the curious painting on the frames of the
  mirrors; the brilliant curtains, with their stiff and formal
  patterns. It was not very much like a home as yet; it was more like a
  picture that had been carefully planned and executed; but she knew
  how he had thought of pleasing <span class="pagenum">[pg 100]</span>
  her in choosing these things, and without saying a word she took his
  hand and kissed it. And then she went to one of the three tall French
  windows and looked out on the square. There, between the trees, was a
  space of beautiful soft green, and some children dressed in bright
  dresses, and attended by a governess in sober black, had just begun
  to play croquet. An elderly lady with a small white dog was walking
  along one of the graveled paths. An old man was pruning some
  bushes.</p>

  <p>&quot;It is very still and quiet here,&quot; said Sheila. &quot;I
  was afraid we should have to live in that terrible noise
  always.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I hope you won&#39;t find it dull, my darling,&quot; he
  said.</p>

  <p>&quot;Dull, when you are here?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But I cannot always be here, you know?&quot;</p>

  <p>She looked up.</p>

  <p>&quot;You see, a man is so much in the way if he is dawdling about
  a house all day long. You would begin to regard me as a nuisance,
  Sheila, and would be for sending me out to play croquet with those
  young Carruthers, merely that you might get the rooms dusted.
  Besides, you know I couldn&#39;t work here: I must have a studio of
  some sort&#8212;in the neighborhood, of course. And then you will
  give me your orders in the morning as to when I am to come round for
  luncheon or dinner.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And you will be alone all day at your work?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Then I will come and sit with you, my poor boy,&quot; she
  said.</p>

  <p>&quot;Much work I should do in that case!&quot; he said. &quot;But
  we&#39;ll see. In the mean time go up stairs and get your things off:
  that young person below has breakfast ready, I dare say.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But you have not shown me yet where Mr. Ingram lives,&quot;
  said Sheila before she went to the door.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, that is miles away. You have only seen a little bit of
  London yet. Ingram lives about as far away from here as the distance
  you have just come, but in another direction.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is like a world made of houses,&quot; said Sheila,
  &quot;and all filled with strangers. But you will take me to see Mr.
  Ingram?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;By and by, yes. But he is sure to drop in on you as soon as
  he fancies you are settled in your new home.&quot;</p>

  <p>And here, at last, was Mr. Ingram come; and the mere sound of his
  voice seemed to carry her back to Borva, so that in talking to him
  and waiting on him as of old she would scarcely have been surprised
  if her father had walked in to say that a coaster was making for the
  harbor, or that Duncan was going over to Stornoway, and Sheila would
  have to give him commissions. Her husband did not take the same
  interest in the social and political affairs of Borva that Mr. Ingram
  did. Lavender had made a pretence of assisting Sheila in her work
  among the poor people, but the effort was a hopeless failure. He
  could not remember the name of the family that wanted a new boat, and
  was visibly impatient when Sheila would sit down to write out for
  some aged crone a letter to her grandson in Canada. Now, Ingram, for
  the mere sake of occupation, had qualified himself during his various
  visits to Lewis, so that he might have become the home minister of
  the King of Borva; and Sheila was glad to have one attentive listener
  as she described all the wonderful things that had happened in the
  island since the previous summer.</p>

  <p>But Ingram had got a full and complete holiday on which to come up
  and see Sheila; and he had brought with him the wild and startling
  proposal that in order that she should take her first plunge into the
  pleasures of civilized life, her husband and herself should drive
  down to Richmond and dine at the Star and Garter.</p>

  <p>&quot;What is that?&quot; said Sheila.</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear girl,&quot; said her husband seriously, &quot;your
  ignorance is something fearful to contemplate. It is quite
  bewildering. How can a person who does not know what the Star and
  Garter is be told what the Star and Garter is?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But I am willing to go and see,&quot; said
  Sheila.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 101]</span>

  <p>&quot;Then I must look after getting a brougham,&quot; said
  Lavender, rising.</p>

  <p>&quot;A brougham on such a day as this?&quot; exclaimed Ingram.
  &quot;Nonsense! Get an open trap of some sort; and Sheila, just to
  please me, will put on that very blue dress she used to wear in
  Borva, and the hat and the white feather, if she has got
  them.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Perhaps you would like me to put on a sealskin cap and a red
  handkerchief instead of a collar,&quot; observed Lavender calmly.</p>

  <p>&quot;You may do as you please. Sheila and I are going to dine at
  the Star and Garter.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;May I put on that blue dress?&quot; said the girl, going up
  to her husband.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, of course, if you like,&quot; said Lavender meekly,
  going off to order the carriage, and wondering by what route he could
  drive those two maniacs down to Richmond so that none of his friends
  should see them.</p>

  <p>When he came back again, bringing with him a landau which could be
  shut up for the homeward journey at night, he had to confess that no
  costume seemed to suit Sheila so well as the rough sailor-dress; and
  he was so pleased with her appearance that he consented at once to
  let Bras go with them in the carriage, on condition that Sheila
  should be responsible for him. Indeed, after the first shiver of
  driving away from the square was over, he forgot that there was much
  unusual about the look of this odd pleasure-party. If you had told
  him eighteen months before that on a bright day in May, just as
  people were going home from the Park for luncheon, he would go for a
  drive in a hired trap with one horse, his companions being a man with
  a brown wide-awake, a girl dressed as though she were the owner of a
  yacht, and an immense deerhound, and that in this fashion he would
  dare to drive up to the Star and Garter and order dinner, he would
  have bet five hundred to one that such a thing would never occur so
  long as he preserved his senses. But somehow he did not mind much. He
  was very much at home with those two people beside him; the day was
  bright and fresh; the horse went a good pace; and once they were over
  Hammersmith Bridge and out among fields and trees, the country looked
  exceedingly pretty, and all the beauty of it was mirrored in
  Sheila&#39;s eyes.</p>

  <p>&quot;All can&#39;t quite make you out in that dress,
  Sheila,&quot; he said. &quot;I am not sure whether it is real and
  business-like or a theatrical costume. I have seen girls on Ryde Pier
  with something of the same sort on, only a good deal more pronounced,
  you know, and they looked like sham yachtsmen; and I have seen
  stewardesses wearing that color and texture of cloth&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But why not leave it as it is,&quot; said
  Ingram&#8212;&quot;a solitary costume produced by certain conditions
  of climate and duties, acting in conjunction with a natural taste for
  harmonious coloring and simple form? That dress, I will maintain,
  sprang as naturally from the salt sea as Aphrodite did; and the man
  who suspects artifice in it or invention has had his mind perverted
  by the skepticism of modern society.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Is my dress so very wonderful?&quot; said Sheila with a
  grave complaisance. &quot;I am pleased that the Lewis has produced
  such a fine thing, and perhaps you would like me to tell you its
  history. It was my papa bought a piece of blue serge in Stornoway: it
  cost three shillings sixpence a yard, and a dressmaker in Stornoway
  cut it for me, and I made it myself. That is all the history of the
  wonderful dress.&quot;</p>

  <p>Suddenly Sheila seized her husband&#39;s arm. They had got down to
  the river by Mortlake; and there, on the broad bosom of the stream, a
  long and slender boat was shooting by, pulled by four oarsmen clad in
  white flannel.</p>

  <p>&quot;How can they go out in such a boat?&quot; said Sheila, with
  a great alarm visible in her eyes. &quot;It is scarcely a boat at
  all; and if they touch a rock or if the wind catches
  them&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t be frightened, Sheila,&quot; said her husband.
  &quot;They are quite safe. There are no rocks in our rivers, and the
  wind does not give us squalls here like those on Loch Roag. You will
  see <span class="pagenum">[pg 102]</span> hundreds of those boats by
  and by, and perhaps you yourself will go out in one.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, never, never!&quot; she said, almost with a shudder.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, if the people here heard you they would not know how
  brave a sailor you are. You are not afraid to go out at night by
  yourself on the sea, and you won&#39;t go on a smooth inland
  river&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But those boats: if you touch them they must go
  over.&quot;</p>

  <p>She seemed glad to get away from the river. She could not be
  persuaded of the safety of the slender craft of the Thames; and
  indeed for some time after seemed so strangely depressed that
  Lavender begged and prayed of her to tell him what was the matter. It
  was simple enough. She had heard him speak of his boating adventures.
  Was it in such boats as that she had just seen? and might he not be
  some day going out in one of them, and an accident&#8212;the breaking
  of an oar, a gust of wind&#8212;</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to reassure her by a solemn promise
  that in no circumstances whatever would he, Lavender, go into a boat
  without her express permission; whereupon Sheila was as grateful to
  him as though he had dowered her with a kingdom.</p>

  <p>This was not the Richmond Hill of her fancy&#8212;this spacious
  height, with its great mansions, its magnificent elms, and its view
  of all the westward and wooded country, with the blue-white streak of
  the river winding through the green foliage. Where was the farm? The
  famous Lass of Richmond Hill must have lived on a farm, but here
  surely were the houses of great lords and nobles, which had
  apparently been there for years and years. And was this really a
  hotel that they stopped at&#8212;this great building that she could
  only compare to Stornoway Castle?</p>

  <p>&quot;Now, Sheila,&quot; said Lavender after they had ordered
  dinner and gone out, &quot;mind you keep a tight hold on that leash,
  for Bras will see strange things in the Park.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is I who will see strange things,&quot; she said; and the
  prophecy was amply fulfilled. For as they went along the broad path,
  and came better into view of the splendid undulations of woodland and
  pasture and fern, when on the one hand they saw the Thames, far below
  them, flowing through the green and spacious valley, and on the other
  hand caught some dusky glimpse of the far white houses of London, it
  seemed to her that she had got into a new world, and that this world
  was far more beautiful than the great city she had left. She did not
  care so much for the famous view from the hill. She had cast one
  quick look to the horizon, with one throb of expectation that the sea
  might be there. There was no sea there&#8212;only the faint blue of
  long lines of country apparently without limit. Moreover, over the
  western landscape a faint haze prevailed, that increased in the
  distance and softened down the more distant woods into a sober gray.
  That great extent of wooded plain, lying sleepily in its pale mists,
  was not so cheerful as the scene around her, where the sunlight was
  sharp and clear, the air fresh, the trees flooded with a pure and
  bright color. Here, indeed, was a cheerful and beautiful world, and
  she was full of curiosity to know all about it and its strange
  features. What was the name of this tree? and how did it differ from
  that? Were not these rabbits over by the fence? and did rabbits live
  in the midst of trees and bushes? What sort of wood was the fence
  made of? and was it not terribly expensive to have such a protection?
  Could not he tell the cost of a wooden fence? Why did they not use
  wire netting? Was not that a loch away down there? and what was its
  name? A loch without a name! Did the salmon come up to it? and did
  any sea-birds ever come inland and build their nests on its
  margin?</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, Bras, you must come and look at the loch. It is a long
  time since you will see a loch.&quot;</p>

  <p>And away she went through the thick breckan, holding on to the
  swaying leash that held the galloping greyhound, and running swiftly
  as though she had been making down for the shore to get out the
  Maighdean-mhara.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 103]</span>

  <p>&quot;Sheila,&quot; called her husband, &quot;don&#39;t be
  foolish!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Sheila,&quot; called Ingram, &quot;have pity on an old
  man!&quot;</p>

  <p>Suddenly she stopped. A brace of partridges had sprung up at some
  little distance, and with a wild whirr of their wings were now
  directing their low and rapid flight toward the bottom of the
  valley.</p>

  <p>&quot;What birds are those?&quot; she said peremptorily.</p>

  <p>She took no notice of the fact that her companions were pretty
  nearly too blown to speak. There was a brisk life and color in her
  face, and all her attention was absorbed in watching the flight of
  the birds. Lavender fancied he saw in the fixed and keen look
  something of old Mackenzie&#39;s gray eye: it was the first trace of
  a likeness to her father he had seen.</p>

  <p>&quot;You bad girl!&quot; he said, &quot;they are
  partridges.&quot;</p>

  <p>She paid no heed to this reproach, for what were those other
  things over there underneath the trees? Bras had pricked up his ears,
  and there was a strange excitement in his look and in his trembling
  frame.</p>

  <p>&quot;Deer!&quot; she cried, with her eyes as fixed as were those
  of the dog beside her.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said her husband calmly, &quot;what although
  they are deer?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But Bras&#8212;&quot; she said; and with that she caught the
  leash with both her hands.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bras won&#39;t mind them if you keep him quiet. I suppose
  you can manage him better than I can. I wish we had brought a
  whip.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I would rather let him kill every deer in the Park than
  touch him with a whip,&quot; said Sheila proudly.</p>

  <p>&quot;You fearful creature, you don&#39;t know what you say. That
  is high treason. If George Ranger heard you, he would have you hanged
  in front of the Star and Garter.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Who is George Ranger?&quot; said Sheila with an air, as if
  she had said, &quot;Do you know that I am the daughter of the King of
  Borva, and whoever touches me will have to answer to my papa, who is
  not afraid of any George Ranger?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He is a great lord who hangs all persons who disturb the
  deer in this Park.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But why do they not go away?&quot; said Sheila impatiently.
  &quot;I have never seen any deer so stupid. It is their own fault if
  they are disturbed: why do they remain so near to people and to
  houses?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear child, if Bras wasn&#39;t here you would probably
  find some of those deer coming up to see if you had any bits of sugar
  or pieces of bread about your pockets.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Then they are like sheep&#8212;they are not like deer,&quot;
  she said with some contempt. &quot;If I could only tell Bras that it
  is sheep he will be looking at, he would not look any more. And so
  small they are! They are as small as the roe, but they have horns as
  big as many of the red-deer. Do people eat them?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I suppose so.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And what will they cost?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am sure I can&#39;t tell you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Are they as good as the roe or the big deer?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t know that, either. I don&#39;t think I ever ate
  fallow-deer. But you know they are not kept here for that purpose. A
  great many gentlemen in this country keep a lot of them in their
  parks merely to look pretty. They cost a great deal more than they
  produce.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;They must eat up a great deal of fine grass,&quot; said
  Sheila almost sorrowfully. &quot;It is a beautiful ground for
  sheep&#8212;no rushes, no peat-moss, only fine, good grass and dry
  land. I should like my papa to see all this beautiful
  ground.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I fancy he has seen it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Was my papa here?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I think he said so.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And did he see those deer?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Doubtless.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He never told me of them.&quot;</p>

  <p>By this time they had pretty nearly got down to the little lake,
  and Bras had been alternately coaxed and threatened into a quiescent
  mood. Sheila evidently expected to hear a flapping of seafowls&#39;
  wings when they got near the margin, and looked all around for the
  first sudden dart from the banks. But <span class="pagenum">[pg
  104]</span> a dead silence prevailed, and as there were neither fish
  nor birds to watch, she went along to a wooden bench and sat down
  there, one of her companions on each hand. It was a pretty scene that
  lay before her&#8212;the small stretch of water ruffled with the
  wind, but showing a dash of blue sky here and there, the trees in the
  enclosure beyond clad in their summer foliage, the smooth green sward
  shining in the afternoon sunlight. Here, at least, was absolute quiet
  after the roar of London; and it was somewhat wistfully that she
  asked her husband how far this place was from her home, and whether,
  when he was at work, she could not come down here by herself.</p>

  <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; he said, never dreaming that she would
  think of doing such a thing.</p>

  <p>By and by they returned to the hotel, and while they sat at dinner
  a great fire of sunset spread over the west, and the far woods became
  of a rich purple, streaked here and there with lines of pale white
  mist. The river caught the glow of the crimson clouds above, and
  shone duskily red amid the dark green of the trees. Deeper and deeper
  grew the color of the sun as it sank to the horizon, until it
  disappeared behind one low bar of purple cloud, and then the wild
  glow in the west slowly faded away, the river became pallid and
  indistinct, the white mists over the distant woods seemed to grow
  denser, and then, as here and there a lamp was lit far down in the
  valley, one or two pale stars appeared in the sky overhead, and the
  night came on apace.</p>

  <p>&quot;It is so strange,&quot; Sheila said, &quot;to find the
  darkness coming on and not to hear the sound of the waves. I wonder
  if it is a fine night at Borva?&quot;</p>

  <p>Her husband went over to her and led her back to the table, where
  the candles, shining over the white cloth and the colored glasses,
  offered a more cheerful picture than the deepening landscape outside.
  They were in a private room, so that, when dinner was over, Sheila
  was allowed to amuse herself with the fruit, while her two companions
  lit their cigars. Where was the quaint old piano now, and the glass
  of hot whisky and water, and the &quot;Lament of Monaltrie&quot; or
  &quot;Love in thine eyes for ever plays&quot;? It seemed, but for the
  greatness of the room, to be a repetition of one of those evenings at
  Borva that now belonged to a far-off past. Here was Sheila, not
  minding the smoke, listening to Ingram as of old, and sometimes
  saying something in that sweetly inflected speech of hers; here was
  Ingram, talking, as it were, out of a brown study, and morosely
  objecting to pretty nearly everything Lavender said, but always ready
  to prove Sheila right; and Lavender himself, as unlike a married man
  as ever, talking impatiently, impetuously and wildly, except at such
  times as he said something to his young wife, and then some brief
  smile and look or some pat on the hand said more than words. But
  where, Sheila may have thought, was the one wanting to complete the
  group? Has he gone down to Borvabost to see about the cargoes of fish
  to be sent off in the morning? Perhaps he is talking to Duncan
  outside about the cleaning of the guns or making up cartridges in the
  kitchen. When Sheila&#39;s attention wandered away from the talk of
  her companions she could not help listening for the sound of the
  waves; and as there was no such message coming to her from the great
  wooded plain without, her fancy took her away across that mighty
  country she had traveled through, and carried her up to the island of
  Loch Roag, until she almost fancied she could smell the peat-smoke in
  the night-air, and listen to the sea, and hear her father pacing up
  and down the gravel outside the house, perhaps thinking of her as she
  was thinking of him.</p>

  <p>This little excursion to Richmond was long remembered by those
  three. It was the last of their meetings before Sheila was ushered
  into the big world to busy herself with new occupations and cares. It
  was a pleasant little journey throughout, for as they got into the
  landau to drive back to town the moon was shining high up in the
  southern heavens, and the air was mild and fresh, <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 105]</span> so that they had the carriage opened, and
  Sheila, well wrapped up, lay and looked around her with a strange
  wonder and joy as they drove underneath the shadow of the trees and
  out again into the clear sheen of the night. They saw the river, too,
  flowing smoothly and palely down between its dark banks; and somehow
  here the silence checked them, and they hummed no more those duets
  they used to sing up at Borva. Of what were they thinking, then, as
  they drove through the clear night along the lonely road? Lavender,
  at least, was rejoicing at his great good fortune that he had secured
  for ever to himself the true-hearted girl who now sat opposite him,
  with the moonlight touching her face and hair; and he was laughing to
  himself at the notion that he did not properly appreciate her or
  understand her or perceive her real character. If not he, who then?
  Had he not watched every turn of her disposition, every expression of
  her wishes, every grace of her manner and look of her eyes? and was
  he not overjoyed to find that the more he knew of her the more he
  loved her? Marriage had increased rather than diminished the mystery
  and wonder he had woven about her. He was more her lover now than he
  had been before his marriage. Who could see in her eyes what he saw?
  Elderly folks can look at a girl&#39;s eyes, and see that they are
  brown or blue or green, as the case may be; but the lover looks at
  them and sees in them the magic mirror of a hundred possible worlds.
  How can he fathom the sea of dreams that lies there, or tell what
  strange fancies and reminiscences may be involved in an absent look?
  Is she thinking of starlit nights on some distant lake, or of the old
  bygone days on the hills? All her former life is told there, and yet
  but half told, and he longs to become possessed of all the beautiful
  past that she has seen. Here is a constant mystery to him, and there
  is a singular and wistful attraction for him in those still deeps
  where the thoughts and dreams of an innocent soul lie but half
  revealed. He does not see those things in the eyes of women he is not
  in love with; but when in after years he is carelessly regarding this
  or the other woman, some chance look, some brief and sudden turn of
  expression, will recall to him, as with a stroke of lightning, all
  the old wonder-time, and his heart will go nigh to breaking to think
  that he has grown old, that he has forgotten so much, and that the
  fair, wild days of romance and longing are passed away for ever.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ingram thinks I don&#39;t understand you yet, Sheila,&quot;
  he said to her after they had got home and their friend had gone.</p>

  <p>Sheila only laughed, and said, &quot;I don&#39;t understand myself
  sometimes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Eh? What?&quot; he cried. &quot;Do you mean to say that I
  have married a conundrum? If I have, I don&#39;t mean to give you up,
  any way; so you may go and get me a biscuit and a drop of the whisky
  we brought from the North with us.&quot;</p><a name="thulechxi" id=

  <h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

  <h3>THE FIRST PLUNGE.</h3>

  <p>Frank Lavender was a good deal more concerned than he chose to
  show about the effect that Sheila was likely to produce on his aunt;
  and when at length the day arrived on which the young folks were to
  go down to Kensington Gore, he had inwardly to confess that Sheila
  seemed a great deal less perturbed than himself. Her perfect calmness
  and self-possession surprised him. The manner in which she had
  dressed herself, with certain modifications which he could not help
  approving, according to the fashion of the time, seemed to him a
  miracle of dexterity; and how had she acquired the art of looking at
  ease in this attire, which was much more cumbrous than that she had
  usually worn in Borva?</p>

  <p>If Lavender had but known the truth, he would have begun to
  believe something of what Ingram had vaguely hinted. This poor girl
  was looking toward her visit to Kensington Gore as the most painful
  trial of her life. While she was outwardly calm and firm, and even
  cheerful, her heart sank within her as <span class="pagenum">[pg
  106]</span> she thought of the dreaded interview. Those garments
  which she wore with such an appearance of ease and comfort had been
  the result of many an hour of anxiety, for how was she to tell, from
  her husband&#39;s railery, what colors the terrible old lady in
  Kensington would probably like? He did not know that every word he
  said in joke about his aunt&#39;s temper, her peevish ways, the awful
  consequences of offending her, and so forth, were like so many
  needles stuck into the girl&#39;s heart, until she was ready to cry
  out to be released from this fearful ordeal. Moreover, as the day
  came near what he could not see in her she saw in him. Was she likely
  to be reassured when she perceived that her husband, in spite of all
  his fun, was really anxious, and when she knew that some blunder on
  her part might ruin him? In fact, if he had suspected for a moment
  that she was really trembling to think of what might happen, he might
  have made some effort to give her courage.</p>

  <p>But apparently Sheila was as cool and collected as if she had been
  going to see John the Piper. He believed she could have gone to be
  presented to the queen without a single tremor of the heart.</p>

  <p>Still, he was a man, and therefore bound to assume an air of
  patronage. &quot;She won&#39;t eat you, really,&quot; he said to
  Sheila as they were driving in a hansom down Kensington Palace
  Gardens. &quot;All you have got to do is to believe in her theories
  of food. She won&#39;t make you a martyr to them. She measures every
  half ounce of what she eats, but she won&#39;t starve you; and I am
  glad to think, Sheila, that you have brought a remarkably good and
  sensible appetite with you from the Lewis. Oh, by the way, take care
  you say nothing against Marcus Aurelius.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t know who he was, dear,&quot; observed Sheila
  meekly.</p>

  <p>&quot;He was a Roman emperor and a philosopher. I suppose it was
  because he was an emperor that he found it easy to be a philosopher.
  However, my aunt is nuts on Marcus Aurelius: I beg your pardon, you
  don&#39;t know the phrase. My aunt makes Marcus Aurelius her Bible,
  and she is sure to read you bits from him, which you must believe,
  you know.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I will try,&quot; said Sheila doubtfully, &quot;but
  if&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, it has nothing to do with religion. I don&#39;t think
  anybody knows what Marcus Aurelius means, so you may as well believe
  it. Ingram swears by him, but he is always full of odd
  crotchets.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Does Mr. Ingram believe in Marcus Aurelius?&quot; said
  Sheila with some accession of interest.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, he gave my aunt the book years ago&#8212;confound
  him!&#8212;and ever since she has been a nuisance to her friends. For
  my own part, you know, I don&#39;t believe that Marcus Aurelius was
  quite such an ass as Plato. He talks the same sort of perpetual
  common-places, but it isn&#39;t about the True and the Good and the
  Beautiful. Would you like me to repeat to you one of the Dialogues of
  Plato&#8212;about the immortality of Mr. Cole and the moral effect of
  the South Kensington Museum?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, dear, I shouldn&#39;t,&quot; said Sheila.</p>

  <p>&quot;You deprive yourself of a treat, but never mind. Here we are
  at my aunt&#39;s house.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila timidly glanced at the place while her husband paid the
  cabman. It was a tall, narrow, dingy-looking house of dark brick,
  with some black green ivy at the foot of the walls, and with crimson
  curtains formally arranged in every one of the windows. If Mrs.
  Lavender was a rich old lady, why did she live in such a gloomy
  building? Sheila had seen beautiful white houses in all parts of
  London: her own house, for example, was ever so much more cheerful
  than this one; and yet she had heard with awe of the value of this
  depressing little mansion in Kensington Gore.</p>

  <p>The door was opened by a man, who showed them up stairs and
  announced their names. Sheila&#39;s heart beat quickly. She entered
  the drawing-room with a sort of mist before her eyes, and found
  herself going forward to a lady who sat at the farther end. She had a
  strangely vivid impression, amid all her alarm, <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 107]</span> that this old lady looked like the withered
  kernel of a nut. Or was she not like a cockatoo? It was through no
  anticipation of dislike to Mrs. Lavender that the imagination of the
  girl got hold of that notion. But the little old lady held her head
  like a cockatoo. She had the hard, staring, observant and
  unimpressionable eyes of a cockatoo. What was there, moreover, about
  the decorations of her head that reminded one of a cockatoo when it
  puts up its crest and causes its feathers to look like sticks of
  celery?</p>

  <p>&quot;Aunt Caroline, this is my wife.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am glad to see you, dear,&quot; said the old lady, giving
  her hand, but not rising. &quot;Sit down. When you are a little
  nervous you ought to sit down. Frank, give me that ammonia from the
  mantelpiece.&quot;</p>

  <p>It was a small glass phial, and labeled &quot;Poison.&quot; She
  smelt the stopper, and then handed it to Sheila, telling her to do
  the same.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why did your maid do your hair in such a way?&quot; she
  asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>&quot;I haven&#39;t got a maid,&quot; said Sheila, &quot;and I
  always do my hair so.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t be offended. I like it. But you must not make a
  fool of yourself. Your hair is too much that of a country beauty
  going to a ball. Paterson will show you how to do your
  hair.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, I say, aunt,&quot; cried Lavender with a fine show of
  carelessness, &quot;you mustn&#39;t go and spoil her hair. I think it
  is very pretty as it is, and that woman of yours would simply go and
  make a mop of it. You&#39;d think the girls now-a-days dressed their
  hair by shoving their head into a furze bush and giving it a couple
  of turns.&quot;</p>

  <p>She paid no heed to him, but turned to Sheila and said, &quot;You
  are an only child?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why did you leave your father?&quot;</p>

  <p>The question was rather a cruel one, and it stung Sheila into
  answering bravely, &quot;Because my husband wished me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh. You think your husband is to be the first law of your
  life?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Even when he is only silly Frank Lavender?&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila rose. There was a quivering of her lips, but no weakness in
  the proud, indignant look of her eyes: &quot;What you may say of me,
  that I do not care. But I will not remain to hear my husband
  insulted.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Sheila,&quot; said Lavender, vexed and anxious, and yet
  pleased at the same time by the courage of the
  girl&#8212;&quot;Sheila, it is only a joke. You must not mind: it is
  only a bit of fun.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I do not understand such jests,&quot; she said calmly.</p>

  <p>&quot;Sit down, like a good girl,&quot; said the old lady with an
  air of absolute indifference. &quot;I did not mean to offend you. Sit
  down and be quiet. You will destroy your nervous system if you give
  way to such impulses. I think you are healthy. I like the look of
  you, but you will never reach a good age, as I hope to do, except by
  moderating your passions. That is well: now take the ammonia again,
  and give it to me. You don&#39;t wish to die young, I
  suppose?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am not afraid of dying,&quot; said Sheila.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ring the bell, Frank.&quot;</p>

  <p>He did so, and a tall, spare, grave-faced woman appeared.</p>

  <p>&quot;Paterson, you must put luncheon on to two-ten. I ordered it
  at one-fifty, did I not?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, m&#39;m.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;See that it is served at two-ten, and take this young lady
  and get her hair properly done. You understand? My nephew and I will
  wait luncheon for her.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, m&#39;m.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila rose with a great swelling in her throat. All her courage
  had ebbed away. She had reflected how pained her husband would be if
  she did not please this old lady; and she was now prepared to do
  anything she was told, to receive meekly any remarks that might be
  made to her, to be quite obedient and gentle and submissive. But what
  was this tall and terrible woman going to do to her? Did she really
  mean to cut away those great masses of hair to which <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 108]</span> Mrs. Lavender had objected? Sheila would
  have let her hair be cut willingly for her husband&#39;s sake; but as
  she went to the door some wild and despairing notions came into her
  head of what her husband might think of her when once she was shorn
  of this beautiful personal feature. Would he look at her with
  surprise&#8212;perhaps even with disappointment?</p>

  <p>&quot;Mind you don&#39;t keep luncheon late,&quot; he said to her
  as she passed him.</p>

  <p>She but indistinctly heard him, so great was the trembling within
  her. Her father would scarcely know his altered Sheila when she went
  back to Borva; and what would Mairi say&#8212;Mairi who had many a
  time helped her to arrange those long tresses, and who was as proud
  of them as if they were her own? She followed Mrs. Lavender&#39;s
  tall maid up stairs. She entered a small dressing-room and glanced
  nervously round. Then she suddenly turned, looked for a moment at the
  woman, and said, with tears rushing up into her eyes, &quot;Does Mrs.
  Lavender wish me to cut my hair?&quot;</p>

  <p>The woman regarded her with astonishment: &quot;Cut,
  miss?&#8212;ma&#39;am. I beg your pardon. No, ma&#39;am, not at all.
  I suppose it is only some difference in the arrangement, ma&#39;am.
  Mrs. Lavender is very particular about the hair, and she has asked me
  to show several ladies how to dress their hair in the way she likes.
  But perhaps you would prefer letting it remain as it is,
  ma&#39;am?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh no, not at all!&quot; said Sheila, &quot;I should like to
  have it just as Mrs. Lavender wishes&#8212;in every way just as she
  wishes. Only, it will not be necessary to cut any?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh no, miss&#8212;ma&#39;am; and it would be a great pity,
  if I may say so, to cut <i>your</i> hair.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila was pleased to hear that. Here was a woman who had a large
  experience in such matters among those very ladies of her
  husband&#39;s social circle whom she had been a little afraid to
  meet. Mrs. Paterson seemed to admire her hair as much as the simple
  Mairi had done; and Sheila soon began to have less fear of this
  terrible tiring-woman, who forthwith proceeded with her task.</p>

  <p>The young wife went down stairs with a tower upon her head. She
  was very uncomfortable. She had seen, it is true, that this method of
  dressing the hair really became her&#8212;or rather would become her
  in certain circumstances. It was grand, imposing, statuesque, but
  then she did not feel statuesque just at this moment. She could have
  dressed herself to suit this style of hair; she could have worn it
  with confidence if she had got it up herself; but here she was the
  victim of an experiment. She felt like a school-girl about for the
  first time to appear in public in a long dress, and she was terribly
  afraid her husband would laugh at her. If he had any such
  inclination, he courteously suppressed it. He said the massive
  simplicity of this dressing of the hair suited her admirably. Mrs.
  Lavender said that Paterson was an invaluable woman; and then they
  went down to the dining-room on the ground floor, where luncheon had
  been laid.</p>

  <p>The man who had opened the door waited on the two strangers: the
  invaluable Paterson acted as a sort of hench-woman to her mistress,
  standing by her chair and supplying her wants. She also had the
  management of a small pair of silver scales, in which pretty nearly
  everything that Mrs. Lavender took in the way of solid food was
  carefully and accurately weighed. The conversation was chiefly
  alimentary, and Sheila listened with a growing wonder to the
  description of the devices by which the ladies of Mrs. Lavender&#39;s
  acquaintance were wont to cheat fatigue or win an appetite or
  preserve their color. When by accident the girl herself was appealed
  to, she had to confess to an astonishing ignorance of all such
  resources. She knew nothing of the relative strengths and effects of
  wines, though she was frankly ready to make any experiment her
  husband recommended. She knew what camphor was, but had never heard
  of bismuth. On cross-examination she had to admit that eau-de-cologne
  did not seem to her likely to be a pleasant <span class="pagenum">[pg
  109]</span> liquor before going to a ball. Did she not know the
  effect on brown hair of washing it in soda-water every night? She was
  equably confessing her ignorance on all such points, when she was
  startled by a sudden question from Mrs. Lavender. Did she know what
  she was doing?</p>

  <p>She looked at her plate: there was on it a piece of cheese to
  which she had thoughtlessly helped herself. Somebody had called it
  Roquefort&#8212;that was all she knew.</p>

  <p>&quot;You have as much there, child, as would kill a ploughman;
  and I suppose you would not have had the sense to leave it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Is it poison?&quot; said Sheila, regarding her plate with
  horror.</p>

  <p>&quot;All cheese is. Paterson, my scales.&quot;</p>

  <p>She had Sheila&#39;s plate brought to her, and the proper modicum
  of cheese cut, weighed and sent back.</p>

  <p>&quot;Remember, whatever house you are at, never to have more
  Roquefort than that.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It would be simpler to do without it,&quot; said Sheila.</p>

  <p>&quot;It would be simple enough to do without a great many
  things,&quot; said Mrs. Lavender severely. &quot;But the wisdom of
  living is to enjoy as many different things as possible, so long as
  you do so in moderation and preserve your health. You are
  young&#8212;you don&#39;t think of such things. You think, because
  you have good teeth and a clear complexion, you can eat anything. But
  that won&#39;t last. A time will come. Do you not know what the great
  emperor Marcus Antoninus says?&#8212;&#39;In a little while thou wilt
  be nobody and nowhere, like Hadrianus and Augustus.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Sheila.</p>

  <p>She had not enjoyed her luncheon much&#8212;she would rather have
  had a ham sandwich and a glass of spring water on the side of a
  Highland hill than this varied and fastidious repast accompanied by a
  good deal of physiology&#8212;but it was too bad that, having
  successfully got through it, she should be threatened with
  annihilation immediately afterward. It was no sort of consolation to
  her to know that she would be in the same plight with two
  emperors.</p>

  <p>&quot;Frank, you can go and smoke a cigar in the conservatory if
  you please. Your wife will come up stairs with me and have a
  talk.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila would much rather have gone into the conservatory also, but
  she obediently followed Mrs. Lavender up stairs and into the
  drawing-room. It was rather a melancholy chamber, the curtains
  shutting out most of the daylight, and leaving you in a semi-darkness
  that made the place look big and vague and spectral. The little,
  shriveled woman, with the hard and staring eyes and silver-gray hair,
  bade Sheila sit down beside her. She herself sat by a small table, on
  which there were a tiny pair of scales, a bottle of ammonia, a fan,
  and a book bound in an old-fashioned binding of scarlet morocco and
  gold. Sheila wished this old woman would not look at her so. She
  wished there was a window open or a glint of sunlight coming in
  somewhere. But she was glad that her husband was enjoying himself in
  the conservatory; and that for two reasons. One of them was, that she
  did not like the tone of his talk while he and his aunt had been
  conversing together about cosmetics and such matters. Not only did he
  betray a marvelous acquaintance with such things, but he seemed to
  take an odd sort of pleasure in exhibiting his knowledge. He talked
  about the tricks of fashionable women in a mocking way that Sheila
  did not quite like; and of course she naturally threw the blame on
  Mrs. Lavender. It was only when this old lady exerted a godless
  influence over him that her good boy talked in such a fashion. There
  was nothing of that about him up in Lewis, nor yet at home in a
  certain snug little smoking-room which these two had come to consider
  the most comfortable corner in the house. Sheila began to hate women
  who used lip-salve, and silently recorded a vow that never, never,
  never would she wear anybody&#39;s hair but her own.</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you suffer from headaches?&quot; said Mrs. Lavender
  abruptly.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 110]</span>

  <p>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; said Sheila.</p>

  <p>&quot;How often? What is an average? Two a week?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, sometimes I have not a head-ache for three or four
  months at a time.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No toothache?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What did your mother die of?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It was a fever,&quot; said Sheila in a low voice, &quot;and
  she caught it while she was helping a family that was very bad with
  the fever.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Does your father ever suffer from rheumatism?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Sheila. &quot;My papa is the strongest man in
  the Lewis&#8212;I am sure of that.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But the strongest of us, you know,&quot; said Mrs. Lavender,
  looking hardly at the girl&#8212;&quot;the strongest of us will die
  and go into the general order of the universe; and it is a good thing
  for you that, as you say, you are not afraid. Why should you be
  afraid? Listen to this passage.&quot; She opened the red book, and
  guided herself to a certain page by one of a series of colored
  ribbons: &quot;&#39;He who fears death either fears the loss of
  sensation or a different kind of sensation. But if thou shalt have no
  sensation, neither wilt thou feel any harm; and if thou shalt acquire
  another kind of sensation, thou wilt be a different kind of living
  being, and thou wilt not cease to live.&#39; Do you perceive the
  wisdom of that?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Sheila, and her own voice seemed hollow and
  strange to her in this big and dimly-lit chamber.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lavender turned over a few more pages, and proceeded to read
  again; and as she did so, in a slow, unsympathetic, monotonous voice,
  a spell came over the girl, the weight at her heart grew more and
  more intolerable, and the room seemed to grow darker:
  &quot;&#39;Short, then, is the time which every man lives, and small
  the nook of the earth where he lives; and short, too, the longest
  posthumous fame, and even this only continued by a succession of poor
  human beings, who will very soon die, and who know not even
  themselves, much less him who died long ago.&#39; You cannot do
  better than ask your husband to buy you a copy of this book, and give
  it special study. It will comfort you in affliction, and reconcile
  you to whatever may happen to you. Listen: &#39;Soon will the earth
  cover us all; then the earth, too, will change, and the things also
  which result from change will continue to change for ever, and these
  again for ever. For if a man reflects on the changes and
  transformations which follow one another like wave after wave, and
  their rapidity, he will despise everything which is perishable.&#39;
  Do you understand that?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Sheila, and it seemed to her that she was
  being suffocated. Would not the gray walls burst asunder and show her
  one glimpse of the blue sky before she sank into unconsciousness? The
  monotonous tones of this old woman&#39;s voice sounded like the
  repetition of a psalm over a coffin. It was as if she was already
  shut out from life, and could only hear in a vague way the dismal
  words being chanted over her by the people in the other world. She
  rose, steadied herself for a moment by placing her hand on the back
  of the chair, and managed to say, &quot;Mrs. Lavender, forgive me for
  one moment: I wish to speak to my husband.&quot; She went to the
  door&#8212;Mrs. Lavender being too surprised to follow her&#8212;and
  made her way down stairs. She had seen the conservatory at the end of
  a certain passage. She reached it, and then she scarcely knew any
  more, except that her husband caught her in his arms as she cried,
  &quot;Oh, Frank, Frank, take me away from this house! I am afraid: it
  terrifies me!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Sheila, what on earth is the matter? Here, come out into the
  fresh air. By Jove, how pale you are! Will you have some
  water?&quot;</p>

  <p>He could not get to understand thoroughly what had occurred. What
  he clearly did learn from Sheila&#39;s disjointed and timid
  explanations was that there had been another &quot;scene,&quot; and
  he knew that of all things in the world his aunt hated
  &quot;scenes&quot; the worst. As soon as he saw that there was little
  the matter <span class="pagenum">[pg 111]</span> with Sheila beyond
  considerable mental perturbation, he could not help addressing some
  little remonstrance to her, and reminding her how necessary it was
  that she should not offend the old lady up stairs.</p>

  <p>&quot;You should not be so excitable, Sheila,&quot; he said.
  &quot;You take such exaggerated notions about things. I am sure my
  aunt meant nothing unkind. And what did you say when you came
  away?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I said I wanted to see you. Are you angry with me?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, of course not. But then, you see, it is a little vexing
  just at this moment. Well, let us go up stairs at once, and try and
  make up some excuse, like a good girl. Say you felt
  faint&#8212;anything.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And you will come with me?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes. Now do try, Sheila, to make friends with my aunt.
  She&#39;s not such a bad sort of creature as you seem to think.
  She&#39;s been very kind to me&#8212;she&#39;ll be very kind to you
  when she knows you more.&quot;</p>

  <p>Fortunately, no excuse was necessary, for Mrs. Lavender, in
  Sheila&#39;s absence, had arrived at the conclusion that the
  girl&#39;s temporary faintness was due to that piece of
  Roquefort.</p>

  <p>&quot;You see you must be careful,&quot; she said when they
  entered the room. &quot;You are unaccustomed to a great many things
  you will like afterward.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And the room is a little close,&quot; said Lavender.</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; said his aunt, sharply:
  &quot;look at the barometer.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I didn&#39;t mean for you and me, Aunt Caroline,&quot; he
  said, &quot;but for her. Sheila has been accustomed to live almost
  wholly in the open air.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The open air in moderation is an excellent thing. I go out
  myself every afternoon, wet or dry. And I was going to propose,
  Frank, that you should leave her here with me for the afternoon, and
  come back and dine with us at seven. I am going out at four-thirty,
  and she could go with me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It&#39;s very kind of you, Aunt Caroline, but we have
  promised to call on some people close by here at four.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila looked up frightened. The statement was an audacious
  perversion of the truth. But then Frank Lavender knew very well what
  his aunt meant by going into the open air every afternoon, wet or
  dry. At one certain hour her brougham was brought round: she got into
  it, and had both doors and windows hermetically sealed, and then, in
  a semi-somnolent state, she was driven slowly and monotonously round
  the Park. How would Sheila fare if she were shut up in this box? He
  told a lie with great equanimity, and saved her.</p>

  <p>Then Sheila was taken away to get on her things, and her husband
  waited, with some little trepidation, to hear what his aunt would say
  about her. He had not long to wait.</p>

  <p>&quot;She&#39;s got a bad temper, Frank.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think so, Aunt Caroline,&quot; he said,
  considerably startled.</p>

  <p>&quot;Mark my words, she&#39;s got a bad temper, and she is not
  nearly so soft as she tries to make out. That girl has a great deal
  of firmness, Frank.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I find her as gentle and submissive as a girl could
  be&#8212;a little too gentle, perhaps, and anxious to study the
  wishes of other folks.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That is all very well with you. You are her master. She is
  not likely to quarrel with her bread and butter. But you&#39;ll see
  if she does not hold her own when she gets among your
  friends.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I hope she will hold her own.&quot;</p>

  <p>The old lady only shook her head.</p>

  <p>&quot;I am sorry you should have taken a prejudice against her,
  Aunt Caroline,&quot; said the young man humbly.</p>

  <p>&quot;I take a prejudice! Don&#39;t let me hear the word again,
  Frank. You know I have no prejudices. If I cannot give you a reason
  for anything I believe, then I cease to believe it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You have not heard her sing,&quot; he said, suddenly
  remembering that this means of conquering the old lady had been
  neglected.</p>

  <p>&quot;I have no doubt she has many accomplishments,&quot; said
  Aunt Caroline coldly. &quot;In time, I suppose, she will get over
  that extraordinary accent she has.&quot;</p><span class="pagenum">[pg
  112]</span>

  <p>&quot;Many people like it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I dare say you do&#8212;at present. But you may tire of it.
  You married her in a hurry, and you have not got rid of your romance
  yet. At the same time, I dare say she is a very good sort of girl,
  and will not disgrace you if you instruct her and manage her
  properly. But remember my words&#8212;she has a temper, and you will
  find it out if you thwart her.&quot;</p>

  <p>How sweet and fresh the air was, even in Kensington, when Sheila,
  having dressed and come down stairs, and after having dutifully
  kissed Mrs. Lavender and bade her good-bye, went outside with her
  husband! It was like coming back to the light of day from inside the
  imaginary coffin in which she had fancied herself placed. A soft west
  wind was blowing over the Park, and a fairly clear sunlight shining
  on the May green of the trees. And then she hung on her husband&#39;s
  arm, and she had him to speak to instead of the terrible old woman
  who talked about dying.</p>

  <p>And yet she hoped she had not offended Mrs. Lavender, for
  Frank&#39;s sake. What he thought about the matter he prudently
  resolved to conceal.</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you know that you have greatly pleased my aunt?&quot; he
  said, without the least compunction. He knew that if he breathed the
  least hint about what had actually been said, any possible amity
  between the two women would be rendered impossible for ever.</p>

  <p>&quot;Have I, really?&quot; said Sheila, very much astonished, but
  never thinking for a moment of doubting anything said by her
  husband.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, she likes you awfully,&quot; he said with an infinite
  coolness.</p>

  <p>&quot;I am so glad!&quot; said Sheila, with her face brightening.
  &quot;I was so afraid, dear, I had offended her. She did not look
  pleased with me.&quot;</p>

  <p>By this time they had got into a hansom, and were driving down to
  the South Kensington Museum. Lavender would have preferred going into
  the Park, but what if his aunt, in driving by, were to see them? He
  explained to Sheila the absolute necessity of his having to tell that
  fib about the four-o&#39;clock engagement; and when she heard
  described the drive in the closed brougham which she had escaped,
  perhaps she was not so greatly inclined as she ought to have been to
  protest against that piece of wickedness.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh yes, she likes you awfully,&quot; he repeated, &quot;and
  you must get to like her. Don&#39;t be frightened by her harsh way of
  saying things: it is only a mannerism. She is really a kind-hearted
  woman, and would do anything for me. That&#39;s her best feature,
  looking at her character from my point of view.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;How often must we go to see her?&quot; asked Sheila.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, not very often. But she will get up dinner-parties, at
  which you will be introduced to batches of her friends. And then the
  best thing you can do is to put yourself under her instructions, and
  take her advice about your dress and such matters, just as you did
  about your hair. That was very good of you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am glad you were pleased with me,&quot; said Sheila.
  &quot;I will do what I can to like her. But she must talk more
  respectfully of you.&quot;</p>

  <p>Lavender laughed that little matter off as a joke, but it was no
  joke to Sheila. She would try to like that old woman&#8212;yes: her
  duty to her husband demanded that she should. But there are some
  things that a wife&#8212;especially a girl who has been newly made a
  wife&#8212;will never forget; which, on the contrary, she will
  remember with burning cheeks and anger and indignation.</p>

  <h2>SOME PASSAGES IN SHELLEY&#39;S EARLY HISTORY.</h2>

  <p>Shelley&#39;s connection with Stockdale is one of the curiosities
  of literary history. It is as if Miranda had attached herself to the
  fortunes of Caliban. An inexplicable thing, except upon the
  assumption of the young poet&#39;s inexperience of men and his
  ignorance of affairs. It is, moreover, a new passage in his life
  which has hitherto eluded the most sagacious of his biographers. Who
  was Stockdale, and what was the relationship between these two
  personages, so opposite in character, intellect and pursuits?
  Stockdale&#39;s name was altogether unknown to honest folks before
  Shelley gave it currency and introduced the owner of it to polite
  society&#8212;at all events on paper. He owes his notoriety,
  therefore, entirely to the boy-poet, into whose way the good man was
  thrown by one of those inexplicable freaks of chance which often
  bring about such strange results both to subject and object.</p>

  <p>John Joseph Stockdale was, like his father, a bookseller, who did
  a low sort of business in Pall Mall. For some forty years the
  Stockdales, father and son, were jointly or separately the John
  Murrays of the London Bohemians. Their house was the resort of
  novelists, poets, and especially dramatic writers, for twenty years
  before and twenty years after the close of the eighteenth century,
  and they were purveyors-general of circulating libraries, tempting
  the ambition of young authors with rosy promises of success and
  alluring baits of immortality, if they could only find the base
  metals <i>in quantum stiff</i>, to pay the cold-blooded
  paper-merchant and the vulgar type-setter. Many a poetic pigeon did
  the Stockdales pluck, no doubt, by these expedients. For in those
  days, as in these present, a young suckling full of innocence and his
  mother&#39;s nourishment deemed it the highest earthly honor to be
  admitted to the society of Bohemian bulls and fire-breathing poets;
  and to be further allowed the privilege of paying for dinner and
  wine, with dramatists and men of the Bohemian kidney as guests, was a
  distinction for which no amount of pecuniary disbursement could by
  any possibility be regarded as an equivalent.</p>

  <p>It is hardly to be supposed, however, that Shelley&#8212;even if
  it could be shown that he actually joined the mob of Stockdale&#39;s
  wits as hale-fellow-well-met&#8212;ever participated in this loyalty
  to their sovran virtues and superiorities. He was the god, not they;
  and although he hid his divinity under a mask and knew the value of
  silence in a court of fools, yet he could not fail to be conscious
  that small and unimportant as he was held to be among those Titans of
  imagination and song, yet it would be found upon trial that he alone
  could bend the mighty bow of Ulysses, and had the right to wear the
  garland and singing-robes of the poet.</p>

  <p>But the prior question remains, how Shelley, of all men then
  living, came to have any knowledge of such a person as
  Stockdale&#8212;still more, any dealings with him.</p>

  <p>And it is remarkable that the answer to this question comes from
  one and the same source; and that is the private journal of Stockdale
  himself, who, like the petty Boswells of the serial literature of the
  present day, cozened, by flattery and other arts best known to that
  class, a considerable number of scholars and authors into a
  correspondence with him, and carefully preserving these their private
  letters until time should have enhanced the value of the autographs,
  and he could glorify himself in the fame of the writers, deliberately
  ransacked his old archives for this purpose; and finding a number of
  the boy Shelley&#39;s business-letters to him&#8212;curious, to be
  sure, and interesting enough to a hero-worshiper&#8212;he audaciously
  published them in an unclean magazine called <i>Stockdale&#39;s
  Budget</i>.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 114]</span>

  <p>Personally, we know nothing of the <i>Budget</i>, but an English
  bookworm sets it down as &quot;a sort of appendix to the more
  celebrated <i>Memoirs of Harriet Wilson&quot;</i>, which Stockdale
  had himself published a few years before. This was so boldly
  licentious, and so reckless in its attacks upon the private
  characters of the Upper Ten, that the publisher was prosecuted with
  merciless persistency until his business gave up the ghost. To
  convince the public that he was a martyr he started the <i>Budget</i>
  in 1827, and still appears to have kept his poets and dramatic
  satellites around him, and to have been a man of some repute for
  good-nature to young authors. Indeed, it is but fair to say that from
  the first moment of Shelley&#39;s introduction to him until we find
  him betraying Shelley&#39;s confidence in him to his father, to save
  him, if possible, from the publication of an atheistic theorem, he
  seems to have been fascinated by the young poet&#39;s character, and
  has testified under his own name that he had the highest confidence
  in his integrity, although it seems he lost a round sum by him in the
  end; and he adds that, in his belief, Shelley would &quot;vegetate
  rather than live, in order to pay any honest debt.&quot;</p>

  <p>It was in 1810 that Shelley, impressed somehow or other with the
  belief that Stockdale was the poet&#39;s friend, rushed pell-mell
  into the publisher&#39;s <i>Pall Mall</i> shop, and besought him to
  do the friendly thing by him, and help him out of a scrape he had got
  into with his printer by ordering him to print fourteen hundred and
  eighty copies of a volume of poems, without having the money at hand
  to pay him. &quot;Aldus of Horsham, the mute and the
  inglorious,&quot; was finally, appeased, although not by
  Stockdale&#39;s money, and the edition of the poems passed into
  Stockdale&#39;s hands for sale. The book was entitled <i>Original
  Poetry, by Victor and Cazire</i>, and we are informed that an
  advertisement of the same appeared in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
  September 18, 1810.</p>

  <p>Shelley had previously published a romance called
  <i>Zastrozzi</i>, and his first kitten-love, Harriet Grove, is said
  to have helped both in this performance and the poems. But Harriet
  was not mindful of the commandment against stealing, and when
  Stockdale came to examine the poems he found that she had taken one
  entire poem by Monk Lewis and put it in among the
  &quot;original&quot; poetry. Shelley ordered the edition to be
  &quot;squelched,&quot; but nearly a hundred copies had already been
  issued; and this fact, so maddening to the poet, may yet rejoice the
  collector of rare books.</p>

  <p>These poems, the <i>Wandering Jew</i>, an epic, the joint
  production of himself and Captain Medwin, a school-boy production,
  <i>St. Irvyne, or the Rosicrucian</i>, and his first story,
  <i>Zastrozzi</i>, are the first books of the poet; and their history
  is detailed with more or less interest in the letters which passed
  between Shelley and Stockdale respecting them. The poet tells
  Stockdale, in offering him the manuscript of the <i>Jew</i> for
  publication, that he had previously to knowing him sent it to John
  Ballantyne &amp; Co., and encloses their letter setting forth the
  reason that they did not publish it&#8212;namely, that it contained
  &quot;atheistical opinions.&quot; The canny Scots are sorry to return
  it, and do so only &quot;after the most mature deliberation.&quot;
  They think that it is better suited, &quot;perhaps,&quot; to the
  &quot;character and liberal feelings of the English than the bigoted
  spirit which yet pervades many cultivated minds in this
  country;&quot; adding, &quot;Even Walter Scott is assailed on all
  hands at present by our Scotch spiritual and evangelical magazines
  and instructors for having promulgated atheistical doctrines in the
  <i>Lady of the Lake</i>.&quot;</p>

  <p>Shelley assures Stockdale he is unconscious of atheism in the
  <i>Few</i>, and asks him &quot;upon his honor as a gentleman to pay a
  fair price for the copy-right.&quot;</p>

  <p>Stockdale never received the manuscript of the <i>Jew</i>, and
  Shelley, having submitted a copy in manuscript to Campbell and
  received an adverse judgment, does not seem to have troubled himself
  further about it. So it remained in must and dust until 1831, when
  somebody of the Stockdale ilk discovered it, and <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 115]</span> printed parts of it in <i>Frazer&#39;s
  Magazine</i>. Judging from these excerpts, the book was entirely
  worthless, and as for the stories, they were neither better nor worse
  than other school-boy pieces of those days.</p>

  <p>The betrayal of confidence of which Shelley complained as
  proceeding from Stockdale arose from a letter of the poet&#39;s, in
  which (November 12, 1810) he asks his friend the publisher to send
  him a &quot;Hebrew essay demonstrating the falsehood of the Christian
  religion,&quot; and which the <i>Christian Observer</i>, he says,
  calls &quot;an unanswerable but sophistical argument.&quot; Have it
  he must, be it translated into &quot;Greek, Latin or any of the
  European languages.&quot;</p>

  <p>Pendulous Stockdale&#8212;&quot;long and lank and
  brown&quot;&#8212;comes from the reek and sin and filth of <i>Harriet
  Wilson&#39;s Memoirs</i>, his pet publication, and actually trembles
  with godly fear for the safety of a human soul, and that soul the
  interior, eternal esse of the son of a baronet; which baronet he
  hopes to make a good money-friend of by betraying his son&#39;s
  secrets to him. Love, of a sort, for Shelley may also have been a
  constituent of his motive to this treachery, as the poet called it,
  for there can be no doubt that he did love him in his way, as all the
  rough fellows&#8212;his Comus crew of the <i>Budget</i>
  office&#8212;loved him.</p>

  <p>Old Sir Timothy is grateful to the bookseller for abusing the
  trust put in him by his son, and he thanks him for what he calls the
  &quot;liberal and handsome manner&quot; in which Stockdale has
  imparted to him his sentiments toward Shelley, and says he shall ever
  esteem it and hold it in remembrance.</p>

  <p>The publication of the letters before us sets at rest the disputed
  point as to the date of Shelley&#39;s first acquaintance with Harriet
  Westbrook, whom he subsequently married. Writing to Stockdale
  December 18, 1810, he requests him to send copies of the new romance
  to Miss Marshall, Horsham, Sussex, T. Medwin, Esq., Horsham, Sussex,
  T.J. Hogg, Esq., Rev. Dayrells Lynnington, Dayrell, Bucks; and Jan.
  11, 1811, writing to the same person, he asks him to send a copy of
  <i>St. Irvyne</i> to Miss Harriet Westbrook, 10 Chapel street,
  Grosvenor Square. It is pretty certain, therefore, that the
  acquaintance began between the dates of these two letters, for if he
  had known Harriet when he ordered his book to be sent to Miss
  Marshall, he would certainly have coupled the two names together and
  added them to the little list of his friends already given. Our
  English friend suggests here that Shelley may not have known Harriet
  personally at this time, but merely through the reports of his
  sisters, who were always talking about her, as reported in the
  <i>Shelley Memorials</i>. We think this is likely to be the case, as
  during that period Shelley does not seem to have journeyed to London.
  The aforesaid friend says also that he possessed a manuscript
  (unpublished) in which somebody who knows states that Shelley first
  saw her in January, 1811, and that whenever this manuscript is
  published it will be seen how very slight was Shelley&#39;s
  acquaintance with Harriet before their marriage, and &quot;what
  advantage was taken of his chivalry of sentiment and her complacent
  disposition, and the inexperience of both, and how little entitled or
  disposed she felt herself to complain of his behavior.&quot;
  &quot;Shelley and his girl-wife visited Windermere,&quot; we think
  are the words of De Quincey in alluding to their sudden apparition in
  the Lake district just after their union. And two more discordant
  natures could hardly have been bound together till death.</p>

  <p>The last friendly communication which passed between Shelley and
  his publisher was dated January 11, 1811, as we have seen; and he
  must immediately afterward have discovered the treachery of
  Stockdale, for only three days later he writes a vituperative letter
  against him to Hogg, in that he had been traducing Hogg&#39;s
  character; and informs him that he will, while on his way to Oxford,
  compel the publisher to explain not only why he &quot;dared to make
  so free with the character of a gentleman about whom he knew
  nothing,&quot; but why he had been treacherous enough to inform
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 116]</span> Sir Timothy that he (Shelley)
  had sent him &quot;a work&quot; which had been submitted to him in
  the strictest confidence and honor.</p>

  <p>This performance was probably the pamphlet which caused
  Shelley&#39;s expulsion from Oxford; and Stockdale hoped to be
  regarded as a friend of the family by telling Sir T. all about it,
  and thus preventing a young aristocrat of such high birth and
  pretensions from falling into the slough of the blackguard
  Free-thinkers. No doubt he was influenced to do this good turn to the
  family by the fact that the bill for the last romance was unpaid, and
  he knew that if Sir Timothy would not, and Shelley, being a minor,
  could not, liquidate it, he would, between the two unreliable stools,
  come to the ground. In order to apologize for Shelley, and make it
  appear to his father that he was not to blame for writing such
  wickedness, but that another had indoctrinated him with all bad
  notions, he pitched upon Hogg as the scapegoat. This is, at all
  events, the English writer&#39;s explanation; but it was a futile as
  well as a foolish thing for the cunning publisher to do, for he made
  them all his enemies, and Sir Timothy refused to pay a farthing of
  the printing account. So the publisher lost it. Shelley, it is true,
  in a cool, polite business letter (April 11, 1811), asks for his
  account, which is delayed, and does not reach the poet until some
  time after it is sent, when it finds him in Radnorshire, Wales, too
  poor to pay it. With an innocency worthy of the days of Adam and Eve,
  he, after promising to pay as soon as he can, offers Stockdale the
  manuscript of some metaphysical and moral essays&#8212;the result of
  &quot;some serious studies&quot;&#8212;&quot;in part payment of his
  debt.&quot;</p>

  <h2>OUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.</h2>

  <h3><a name="sleeping" id="sleeping"><!-- H2 anchor --></a> A
  SLEEPING-CAR SERENADE.</h3>

  <p>Not long ago I had to travel by the night-express from Montreal to
  New York, and feeling drowsy about eleven o&#39;clock, presented my
  claim for a lower berth in the car paradoxically designated
  &quot;sleeping,&quot; and tantalizingly named &quot;palace,&quot;
  with sanguine hopes of obtaining a refreshing snooze. Knowing from
  experience the aberrations of mind peculiar to travelers roused from
  sleep, by which they are impelled to get off at way-stations, I
  secured my traps against the contingencies liable to unchecked
  baggage, and creeping into the back of the sepulchral shelf called a
  bed, I enveloped myself after the fashion of Indian squaws and
  Egyptian mummies, and fell asleep.</p>

  <p>I do not know whether the noise and concussion of the cars excite
  the same sort of dreams in every one&#39;s cranium as they do in
  mine, but they almost invariably produce in my brain mental phenomena
  of a pugnacious character, which are nothing modified by palace cars
  and steel rails. This particular night there was a perfect revelry of
  dreams in my brain. I was on the frontier with our corps, engaged in
  a glorious hand-to-hand conflict with men our equals in number and
  valor. We were having the best of it, giving it to them hot and
  heavy, crash! through the beggars&#39; skulls, and plunge! into their
  abominable abdominal regions. &quot;No quarter!&quot; It was a pity,
  but it seemed splendid.</p>

  <p>Bang! roared an Armstrong gun, as I thought, close to my ear: down
  went a whole column of the enemy like a flash, as I awoke to find it
  a dream, alas! and the supposed artillery nothing more or less than
  one of those sharp, gurgling snorts produced during inspiration in
  the larynx of a stout Jewish gentleman, who had in some mysterious
  way got on the outer half of my shelf during my sleep, and whose
  ancient descent was clearly defined in the side view I immediately
  obtained of the contour and size of his nose. I had got one of my
  arms out from under the covering, and found I had &quot;cut
  left&quot; directly upon the prominent proboscis of my friend&#8212;a
  passage of <span class="pagenum">[pg 118]</span> arms that materially
  accelerated his breathing, and awoke him to the fact that though he
  had a nose sufficiently large to have entitled him to Napoleon&#39;s
  consideration for a generalship had he lived in the days of that
  potentate, yet there was something unusual on the end of it, which
  was far too large for a pimple and rather heavy for a fly. Perhaps it
  induced a nightmare, and deluded him into the belief that he had been
  metamorphosed into an elephant, and hadn&#39;t become accustomed to
  his trunk. It puzzled me to know how or why he had been billeted on
  my palatial shelf, for the whole of which I had paid; but as it was
  rather a cold night, and there was something respectable in the
  outline of that Roman nose, I turned my back on him and determined to
  accept the situation, soothing myself with the reflection that if I
  repeated the assault upon his nose, such an accident must be excused
  as a fortuitous result of his unauthorized intrusion.</p>

  <p>I had just got freshly enveloped in the &quot;honey-dew of
  slumber&quot; when my <i>compagnon de voyage</i> began to snore, and
  in the most unendurable manner, the effect of which was nothing
  improved by his proximity. It seemed to penetrate every sense and
  sensation of my body, and to intensify the extreme of misery which I
  had begun to endure in the hard effort to sleep. His snore was a
  medley of snuffing and snorting, with an abortive demi-semi
  aristocratic sort of a sneeze; while to add to the effect of this
  three-stringed inspiration there was in each aspiration a tremulous
  and swooning neigh. I had been reading <i>The Origin of Species</i>
  and <i>The Descent of Man</i> for several previous days, and began to
  think I had discovered some wandering Jewish lost link between man
  and the monkey, and that I actually had him or it for a bedfellow;
  but by the dim light of the car-lamps I managed to see his hands,
  which had orthodox nails. I was now thoroughly awake, and found
  myself the victim of a perfect bedlam of snorers from one end of the
  car to the other, making a concatenation of hideous noises only to be
  equaled by a menagerie; though, to give the devil his due, a earful
  of wild animals would never make such an uproar when fast asleep.</p>

  <p>It is a well-known fact that when one&#39;s ears prick up at night
  and find the slightest noise an obstacle to slumber, after much
  tossing and turning, and some imprecating, tired Nature will finally
  succumb from sheer exhaustion: she even conquers the howling of dogs
  holding converse with the moon and the cater-wauling of enamored
  cats. Cats, and even cataracts, I have defied, but of all noises to
  keep a sober man awake I know of none to take the palm from the
  snoring in that car. There seemed to be a bond of sympathy, too,
  among the snorers, for those who did not snore were the only ones who
  did not sleep.</p>

  <p>The varieties of sound were so intensely ridiculous that at first
  I found it amusing to listen to the performance. A musical ear might
  have had novel practice by classifying the intonations. The
  war-whooping snore of my bedfellow changed at times into a deep and
  mellow bass. To the right of us, on the lower shelf, was a happy
  individual indulging in all the variations of a nervous treble of
  every possible pitch: his was an inconstant <i>falsetto</i> in sound
  and cadence. Above him snored one as if he had a metallic reed in his
  larynx that opened with each inhalation: his snore struck me as a
  brassy <i>alto</i>. The tenors were distributed at such distances as
  to convey to my ears all the discord of an inebriated band of cracked
  fifes and split bagpipes playing snatches of different tunes. There
  were snores that beggar description, that seemed to express every
  temperament and every passion of the human soul. I cannot forget one
  a couple of berths off, which seemed to rise above the mediocrity of
  snores, mellowing into a tenderness like the dying strains of an
  echo, and renewing its regular periods with a highbred dignity which
  Nature had clearly not assumed. Another broke away from the harsh
  notes around in soft diapasons, and with a mellifluous <i>soprano</i>
  which I instinctively knew must belong to a throat that <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 119]</span> could sing. Was it Nilsson? Just over my
  head was a jerky croak of a snore, sounding at intervals of half a
  minute, as if it had retired on half-pay and longed to get back into
  active service.</p>

  <p>It occurred to me, when amid these paroxysms of turmoil I heard a
  very fair harmony between the bass of my bedfellow and the tenor of a
  sleeper in the next berth, that if a Gilmore could take snores, into
  training, and by animal magnetism or mesmerism manage to make them
  snore in concert and by note&#8212;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i2">In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and
    soft recorders&#8212;</p>
  </div>

  <p>we should have a diverting performance in sleeping-cars, and one
  objection to their use would be actually utilized as an extra
  inducement to patronize them.</p>

  <p>Several times I was strongly impelled to shunt my bass snorer off
  the bed or twig his Roman nose, but one experiment of a kick roused
  such a vigorous snort, like that produced by dropping a brick on a
  sleeping pig, that I abandoned such physical means of retaliation. I
  thought of tickling his nose with a feather or a straw, but the bed
  contained neither, and I had not even a pin. And supposing I should
  stop my shelf-mate, what could I do to suppress the rest? Should I
  make some horrible noise between a hoarse cough and a crow, and say,
  if any one complained, that it was my way of snoring? But I thought
  that the object to be attained, and the possibility of being voted
  insane and consigned, in spite of protestation, to the baggage-car,
  would not compensate me for the exertion required; so I determined to
  submit to it like a Stoic. (<i>Query:</i> Would a Stoic have
  submitted?)</p>

  <p>The more one meditates upon the reason of wakefulness, the more
  his chances of sleep diminish; and from this cause, conjoined with
  the peculiarity of the situation and the mood in which I found
  myself, I had surely &quot;affrighted sleep&quot; for that night. As
  I lay awake I indulged in the following mental calculation of my
  misery to coax a slumber: The average number of inspirations in a
  minute is fifteen&#8212;remember, snoring is an act of the
  inspiration&#8212;the number of hours I lay awake was six. Fifteen
  snores a minute make nine hundred an hour. Multiply 900 by
  6&#8212;the number of hours I lay awake&#8212;and you have 5400, the
  number of notes struck by each snorer. There were at least twelve
  distinct and regular snorers in the car. Multiply 5400 by 12, and you
  have 64,800 snores, not including the snuffling neighs, perpetrated
  in that car from about eleven P. M. until five the next morning!</p>

  <p>The question follows: &quot;Can snoring be prevented?&quot; It is
  plainly a nuisance, and ought to be indictable. I have heard of the
  use of local stimulants, such as camphire and ammonia&#8212;how I
  longed for the sweet revenge of holding a bottle of aqua ammonia
  under that Roman nose!&#8212;and also of clipping the uvula, which
  may cause snoring by resting on the base of the tongue. The question
  demands the grave consideration of our railroad managers; for while
  the traveling public do not object to a man snoring the roof off if
  he chooses to do it under his own vine and fig tree, tired men and
  women have a right to expect a sleep when they contract for it. Is
  there no lover of sleep and litigation who will prosecute for
  damages?</p>

  <p>There is a prospect, however, of a balm in Gilead. An ingenious
  Yankee&#8212;a commercial traveler&#8212;has invented and patented an
  instrument made of gutta percha, to be fitted to the nose, and pass
  from that protuberance to the tympanum of the ear. As soon as the
  snorer begins the sound is carried so perfectly to his own ear, and
  all other sounds so well excluded, that he awakens in terror. The
  sanguine inventor believes that after a few nights&#39; trial the
  wearer will become so disgusted with his own midnight serenading that
  his sleep will become as sound and peaceable as that of a suckling
  baby.</p>

  <p>And yet there is nothing vulgar in snoring. Chesterfield did it,
  and so did Beau Brummell, and they were the two last men in the world
  to do anything beyond the bounds of propriety, awake or asleep, if
  they could help it. Plutarch tells us that the emperor Otho snored;
  so did <span class="pagenum">[pg 120]</span> Cato; so did George II.,
  and also George IV., who boasted that he was &quot;the first
  gentleman in Europe.&quot; Position has nothing to do with cause and
  effect in snoring, as there are instances on record of soldiers
  snoring while <i>standing</i> asleep in sentry-boxes; and I have
  heard policemen snore <i>sitting</i> on doorsteps, waiting to be
  wakened by the attentive &quot;relief.&quot; We may be sure Alain
  Chartier did not snore when Margaret of Scotland stooped down and
  kissed him while he was asleep, or young John Milton when the
  highborn Italian won from him a pair of gloves; though it did not
  lessen the ardor of philosophical Paddy, when he coaxingly sang
  outside of his true love&#39;s window&#8212;</p>

  <p>Shure, I know by the length of your snore you&#39;re awake.</p>

  <p>But really, I don&#39;t know whether women <i>do</i> snore.
  I&#39;m not sure that the mellifluous <i>soprano</i> snore in the car
  was Nilsson&#39;s, and Paddy may have been joking. I know that only
  male frogs croak.</p>

  <h3>FABLES FOR THE YOUTH.</h3>

  <p><b>THE LION AND THE FOX</b>. The Lion and the Fox once traveled in
  company. Upon their coming to a public-house, it was agreed that the
  former should go in and get a dinner, while Master Reynard kept watch
  at the door. In stalked the Lion boldly, and ordered a haunch of
  venison and a blood-pudding. The servant-maid, instead of fainting
  away, bade him throw his mane over a chair and take his ease. Locking
  the door as she withdrew, she sent for a policeman, and before night
  King Lion was snugly back in the menagerie whence he and his
  companion had that morning escaped.</p>

  <p>Master Reynard, scenting what was in the wind, took to the woods
  and was seen no more.</p>

  <p><i>Moral</i>: This fable teaches us to beware of that pretended
  friendship which is specious and hollow.</p>

  <p><b>THE JUDGEMENT OF PARIS</b>. The Gorilla, the Hippopotamus and
  the Snapping-Turtle were once upon a time partaking of a royal dinner
  at the table of an opulent old Oyster, when the conversation turned
  upon personal beauty. Each one of the guests present claimed for
  himself that he alone was the favorite among the ladies for his
  handsome form and features. As the wine had gone around freely, the
  discussion grew heated, and upon the suggestion of the Gorilla it was
  left to their host to decide between them.</p>

  <p>In vain did Mr. Saddlerock (for that was the host&#39;s name)
  insist that the point was too delicate for so humble an individual as
  himself to presume to pass upon.</p>

  <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; said all three in concert, &quot;tell us honestly
  what you think.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But I may offend you,&quot; urged the bivalve.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, that were impossible,&quot; smiled the Turtle.</p>

  <p>&quot;Quite so,&quot; grunted the Hippopotamus.</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear friend,&quot; added the Gorilla with a leer,
  &quot;as for myself, I am so confident of being considered an Apollo
  that I wish for nothing so much as your candid opinion.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, gentlemen,&quot; replied Mr. Saddlerock, &quot;since
  you all urge me to disclose my real sentiments, I will do so. So far
  from being good-looking, egad! it&#39;s hard telling which of you has
  the ugliest countenance! In fact, you&#39;d better draw lots for
  it.&quot;</p>

  <p>No sooner had this remark fallen from his lips than he saw his
  mistake. He ran to the window, jumped out and vainly attempted to
  climb a tall sycamore in the garden. The Gorilla, seizing him with a
  clutch like that of a vice, dragged him ignominiously back to the
  dining-hall. Here the unhappy Mr. Saddlerock was opened, and the
  wicked Gorilla swallowed his body in a twinkle, flinging thereafter a
  shell to each of the other competitors.</p>

  <p><i>Moral</i>: When the powerful quarrel, don&#39;t let yourself
  become mixed up with them or you may get hurt.</p>

  <p><b>THE SANGUINARY DUEL</b>. Two men fought a duel. Let us
  distinguish them by the names of A and B respectively. It was a real,
  <i>bona-fide</i>, powder-and-ball affair. A meant business: so did
  B.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 121]</span>

  <p>It was a terrible encounter.</p>

  <p>A had all the vocal part of his jaw shot off, and several useful
  portions of his epiglottis carried away. Totally unfitted for his
  business as auctioneer, he died some years after of dyspepsia of the
  brain.</p>

  <p>B parted company with his left arm, so he was compelled to pass
  himself off as a disabled hero of the rebellion and accept a snug
  little office in the United States custom-house, where there was
  nothing whatever to do.</p>

  <p>That is all.</p>

  <p>The dispute grew out of something A had said about B. B said A
  said that B said something, and B said he hadn&#39;t said it.</p>

  <p><i>Moral</i>: Don&#39;t duel.</p>

  <p><b>THE DOG AND THE SPARE-RIB</b>. A mastiff crossing a bridge, and
  bearing in his mouth a piece of meat, suddenly swallowed the meat. He
  immediately observed that the shadow of the aforesaid meat in the
  water had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Such is optics.</p>

  <p><i>Moral</i>: We learn from this fable that life is but a
  shadow.</p>

  <p><b>THE ASS AND THE LOCOMOTIVE</b>. A donkey one day was quietly
  munching thistles when he heard the screaming whistle of a
  locomotive. Pricking up his ears, he started into a gallop and raced
  across lots with his tail high in the air.</p>

  <p><i>Moral</i>: This fable teaches what an ass he was.</p>

  <p><b>THE MOUSE AND THE CAT</b>. A mouse once peeped from his hole
  and saw a cat. The cat was looking the other way, and happened not to
  see the mouse.</p>

  <p>Nobody killed.</p>

  <p><i>Moral</i>: This little fable doesn&#39;t teach anything.</p>

  <h3>A PICTURE WITH A HISTORY</h3>

  <p>In a number of <i>Punch</i> for February, 1873, in the account of
  &quot;Our Representative Man&#39;s&quot; visit to the Exhibition of
  Old Masters, occurs the following sentence: &quot;No 35. Oh, Miss
  Linley (afterward Mrs. Sheridan), oh how lovely you are! Oh, Thomas
  Gainsborough, oh, Thomas Gainsborough, oh! And if Baron Lionel de
  Rothschild, M.P., ever wishes to offer a testimonial to one who knows
  nothing whatever about him, and for no particular object, let him
  send this picture, carriage paid, to the residence of your
  representative, who as his petitioner will never cease to pray at
  convenient seasons, etc.&quot;</p>

  <p>The picture thus apostrophized represents that &quot;Saint
  Cecilia, the beautiful mother of a beautiful race, <a id=

  in 1792) is dated from his seat, Delapre Abbey, and she and Sheridan
  were <i>habitués</i> of his house.</p>

  <p>It was at the death of General Bouverie, grandson of Mrs.
  Sheridan&#39;s friend, that her picture was sold, a few months ago,
  to Baron Rothschild; and a romance might well be woven out of the
  circumstances which caused this painting to be removed from the place
  which it had so long occupied in the library of Delapre Abbey.</p>

  <p>Delapre Abbey is a stately mansion occupying ground once covered
  by a monastery, of which the only remains serve as offices of the
  more modern edifice. Approaching the ancient borough of Northampton
  by the old London road, you observe on your left, about a mile from
  the town, a beautiful specimen&#8212;one of the only three
  remaining&#8212;of the crosses which a king of England raised to
  commemorate the places where his beloved wife&#39;s body rested on
  her last journey to Westminster. It lay one night at the abbey, and,
  whilst that is almost obliterated, the cross remains almost perfect
  after centuries have elapsed, and served mainly as the model for that
  which has recently been erected close to Charing Cross, where
  formerly another of these memorials marked the last halt of the royal
  funereal cortege.</p>

  <p>Mr. Edward Bouverie had several sons, and on the marriage of the
  eldest Delapre Abbey and the estates attached to it were, in
  conformity to common usage in England, settled upon the children of
  this marriage, and, failing issue, on the general&#39;s younger
  brothers and their sons in succession. The general&#39;s marriage
  proved childless, his next brother also left no issue, and at length
  no son remained but a certain somewhat ne&#39;er-do-weel, Frank.</p>

  <p>Frank was an officer in the army. Whilst quartered in the north of
  Ireland he had fallen in love with a girl beneath him in station,
  and, greatly to the disgust of his family, married her. His father,
  who was deeply imbued with aristocratic prejudices, ceased to hold
  intercourse with him, and except that occasional communications
  passed between him and his mother, his relations with his family
  ceased. At length he died, and as it became evident that his brothers
  would never have children, Frank&#39;s son was obviously the heir.
  Under these circumstances the family offered terms to the mother if
  she would give up her son altogether and consent to his being bred a
  Protestant. These overtures she declined. The advice of leading
  lawyers was then sought, but they declared that the settlement of the
  property could not by any possibility be set aside. Meanwhile the
  case suddenly assumed a new aspect.</p>

  <p>About twelve years ago a lady of prodigious energy and
  perseverance made her appearance in the law courts of London, who was
  bent on proving the legitimacy of her grandfather. By &quot;much
  wearying&quot; she prevailed upon Lord Brougham to introduce a bill
  which became known as the &quot;Legitimacy Declaration Act.&quot; By
  the provisions of this measure a person who believes himself heir to
  a property may cite all persons interested to come in at once and
  show cause why he should not be adjudged rightful heir and
  representative of a given person and estate.</p>

  <p>Frank Bouverie&#39;s son resolved, therefore, to take the bull by
  the horns, and save all future trouble by obtaining a decree of
  court. The family very unwisely resolved to oppose his claim. It
  seemed that stories prejudicial to the character of the
  claimant&#39;s mother had been in circulation, and the Bouveries
  grounded their opposition on the allegation that the claimant<a id=
  "footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href=
  "#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> was not in truth a Bouverie at all.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, ample testimony was adduced to show that Frank
  Bouverie, notwithstanding his wife&#39;s irregularity of conduct, had
  always regarded the boy as his son and heir; and one witness told how
  the father had held the little fellow up to look at the picture of
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 123]</span> his ancestral home, and said,
  &quot;All that will one day be yours.&quot; So the Bouveries&#39;
  case broke down entirely, and the ex-private soldier, ex-policeman,
  stepped into the fine old mansion of Delapre with sixty thousand
  dollars a year. It is satisfactory to be able to add that he has
  always borne an excellent character, and seems likely to duly take
  his place as a country gentleman. Of course nothing but the bare
  fabric and land came to him: the personalty was all left to his aunt,
  the general&#39;s widow, an old lady near ninety, who yet survives;
  and it was by her direction that the famous Linley picture once more
  changed hands.</p>

    bit of clay, with which he modeled, and then colored, her
    head&#8212;and that too in a quarter of an hour&#8212;in such a
    manner that I protest it appeared to me even superior to his
    paintings. The next day I took a friend or two to his house to see
    it, but it was not to be seen: the servant had thrown it down from
    the mantelpiece and broken it.&quot; Gainsborough would now and
    then mould the faces of his friends in miniature, finding the
    material in the wax candles burning before him: the models were as
    perfect in their resemblance as his portraits.

    founder of the English branch. Laurence, from mixing with his
    father&#39;s Protestant tenants, had imbibed some of their ideas,
    and his father, a stern Catholic, told him that if he failed to
    appear at mass the following Sunday he would have him examined by
    the Inquisition. In terror he ran away to Frankfort-on-the-Main,
    and there had the luck to fall in with a sympathetic silk
    manufacturer, who made him superintendent of his men. Subsequently
    he married his patron&#39;s niece and heiress, and eventually
    removed to England when Queen Elizabeth offered an asylum there to
    those of the Reformed faith. His family made wealthy alliances and
    prospered, and in 1747 his representative was created a peer. He
    married, first, the heiress of Delapre, and her property went to

  <h3>HINTS FOR NOVEL-WRITERS.</h3>

  <p>&quot;Constance,&quot; said Philip to his sister, &quot;I have got
  on very well with my novel. I have written fifty pages, described my
  hero and heroine, made them thoroughly in love with each other; and
  now I intend to part them for a season, without letting them be
  certain of the state of each other&#39;s heart. I think narrative my
  forte, but it will not do to have no conversations, and my dialogues
  seem so short and trite. Do look over this:</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Helena</i>. Your letter has arrived, I see.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Bertram</i>. Yes, I have just read it.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>H</i>. Well?&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>B</i>. It says I must delay no
  longer.&#39;</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 124]</span>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>H</i>. When shall you start?&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>B</i>. Tomorrow, at the latest.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>H</i>. Have you told my aunt?&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>B</i>. Not yet: I must do it now.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>H</i>. Shall you go direct to London?&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>B</i>. No: I stop one night at the Grange.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>H</i>. Oh, then I will ask you to be the bearer of
  my letter.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>B</i>. Is that <i>all</i> you will permit me to do
  for you?&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>H</i>. I am careful not to burden my
  friends.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>B</i>. Then you have no belief in true
  friendship.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, Philip, let me try whilst you are at the office, and
  see what I can suggest:</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Your letter has arrived, I see</i>,&#39; said
  Helena, turning as Bertram entered, letter in hand.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Yes, I have just read it</i>,&#39; he replied,
  advancing and leaning his arm on the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Well</i>?&#39; said Helena, stooping as if to warm
  her hands, but really endeavoring to shade her face.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>It says I must delay no longer</i>,&#39; he
  answered, trying to assume an air of indifference.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>When shall you start</i>?&#39; she said, resuming
  her work and fixing her eyes on her pattern.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>To-morrow, at the latest</i>,&#39; he replied,
  transferring the letter to his pocket.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Have you told my aunt</i>?&#39; she said, searching
  her work-basket for her scissors.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Not yet: I must do it now</i>,&#39; he said, putting
  back the little ornament his elbow had displaced.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Shall you go direct to London</i>?&#39; she said,
  trying to disentangle a skein of colored yarn.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>No: I stop one night at the Grange</i>,&#39; he said
  quietly, but with an air of decision.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Then I will ask you to be the bearer of my
  letter</i>,&#39; she added, laying down her work as she spoke.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Is that all you will permit me to do for
  you</i>?&#39; he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Oh, I never burden my friends</i>,&#39; she said,
  raising her head and tossing back her curls.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Then you have no belief in true friendship</i>,&#39;
  he answered in a tone of bitterness.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That is pretty good,&quot; said Constance to herself,
  &quot;but I will take these two young people out of doors: perhaps
  Philip may be better pleased:</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Your letter has arrived, I see</i>,&#39; said
  Helena, advancing as Bertram opened the garden gate.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Yes, I have just read it</i>,&#39; he replied as he
  secured the fastening.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Well</i>?&#39; said Helena, taking the path to the
  house.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>It says I must delay no longer</i>,&#39; he replied,
  proffering her a bunch of wild-flowers he had gathered in his
  walk.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>When shall you start</i>?&#39; said Helena, turning
  away to pluck some rosebuds, which she added to her bouquet.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Tomorrow, at the latest</i>,&#39; he answered,
  flinging aside roughly a branch that crossed his path.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Have you told my aunt</i>?&#39; said Helena, tying
  the strings of her hat.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>No: I must do it now</i>,&#39; he said, holding out
  his hand to relieve her of her parasol as they entered the shady
  avenue.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Shall you go direct to London</i>?&#39; she asked
  hurriedly.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>No: I stop one night at the Grange</i>,&#39; he
  said, inviting her by a gesture to take a seat upon a rustic
  bench.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Oh, then I will ask you to be the bearer of my
  letter</i>,&#39; she said, quickening her steps lest he should
  perceive her emotion.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Is that all you will permit me to do for
  you</i>?&#39; he said, with more feeling than he had yet permitted
  himself to show.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Yes: I am careful not to burden my friends</i>,&#39;
  she added, drawing her mantle round her and speaking in a tone of
  irony.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;<i>Then you do not believe in true friendship</i>,&#39;
  he replied as they reached the house, and with a heightened color he
  threw back the hall door and made way for her to
  enter.&quot;</p><a name="note" id="note"><!-- H2 anchor --></a>

  <h2>NOTES.</h2>

  <p>Since the publication of the article on &quot;Salmon Fishing in
  Canada,&quot; in the May Number of this Magazine, the writer has had
  access to the <i>Report of the Department of Fisheries of the
  Dominion of Canada</i>, for 1872. By this document it appears that an
  establishment for the artificial hatching of salmon, whitefish and
  trout is in operation at Newcastle on Lake Ontario, and that two
  millions of fish eggs were put in the hatching-troughs the last
  season. Adult salmon, the produce of this establishment, are now
  found in nearly all the streams between the Bay of Quinté and Niagara
  River. A salmon-breeding establishment is about going into operation
  on the Restigouché, and another is contemplated for the Matapedia,
  both rivers of the Bay of Chaleur.</p>

  <p>The reports from the river overseers indicate that under the
  system of protection all the rivers are improving in the number and
  size of their salmon. There were taken with the rod in
  1872&#8212;from Grand River, 70 fish, average weight 14 pounds;
  Cascapedia, 139 fish, average weight 22 pounds; Restigouche, 500
  fish; Upsalquitch, 70 fish; St. Marguerite, 165 fish; Moisie, 219
  fish, average weight 18 pounds; St. John, 147 fish, average weight 13
  pounds; Mingan, 130 fish; and in most of the rivers the young salmon
  are very numerous.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>It is a familiar observation that great inventions are commonly
  foreshadowed in theory or speculation, and very often are approached
  gradually in a long series of tentative experiments before the
  perfected result is reached. Exceptions occur to this rule, but they
  are exceedingly few, since usually it is a general sense of the need
  of any new device which directs mechanical skill toward supplying it.
  Nevertheless, it is with no little surprise that one reads how
  thoroughly a century ago the entire theory of the modern electric
  telegraph was comprehended; for a most remarkable premonition, so to
  speak, of this great device is contained in a letter recently brought
  to public notice, written by the abbé Barthélemy (the once famous
  author of the <i>Voyage of Anacharsis</i>) to the marchioness du
  Deffand. &quot;I often think,&quot; says the abbé, writing under date
  of Chanteloup, 8th August, 1772, &quot;of an experiment which would
  be a very happy one for us. They say that if two clocks have their
  hands equally magnetized, you need only to move the hands of one to
  make those of the other revolve in the same direction; so that, for
  example, when one strikes twelve, the other will denote the same
  hour. Now, suppose that artificial magnets can some day be so
  improved as to communicate their power from here to Paris: you shall
  procure one of these clocks, and we will have another. Instead of the
  hours, we will mark on the <span class="pagenum">[pg 125]</span> two
  dials the letters of the alphabet. Every day at a certain hour we
  will turn the hands. M. Wiart will put the letters together, and will
  read them thus: &#39;Good-morning, dear little girl! I love you more
  tenderly than ever.&#39; That will be grandmother&#39;s turn at the
  clock. When my turn comes, I shall say about the same thing. Besides,
  we could arrange to have the first motion of the hand strike a bell,
  to give warning that the oracle is about to speak. The fancy pleases
  me wonderfully. It would soon become corrupted, to be sure, by being
  applied to spying in war and in politics; but it would still be very
  pleasant in the intercourse of friendship.&quot; In 1774&#8212;that
  is, two years after Barthélemy&#39;s letter&#8212;Lesage, a Genevese
  professor of physics, guardedly intimated that an apparatus could be
  constructed to fulfill these vague suggestions. There were a few
  experiments in electro-magnetism during the succeeding half century.
  It was reserved for our own Morse to put into practical application
  the grand system which the abbé Barthélemy had so curiously
  foreshadowed in a freak of fancy.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Endless are the blandishments and the seductive devices of trade.
  A famous dry-goods store lately startled the shopping community of
  Paris by opening a free restaurant, a billiard-hall and a
  reading-room for the use and behoof of its customers. When ladies go
  to purchase at this place, while preparing their lists a polite clerk
  escorts them to the <i>buffet</i>, which is set out with ices, cakes,
  madeira wine, and so forth; and, having ended their repast, they are
  again escorted to the counter at which they desire to buy. But
  sometimes ladies bring their escorts&#8212;husbands, brothers or
  other useful bankers and purveyors of lucre&#8212;and the question
  arises, therefore, how to provide for them. The device of the
  reading-room and the billiard-table is interposed for this purpose,
  and a servant in livery informs them when the buying is completed,
  and when their own duties&#8212;namely, of footing the
  bills&#8212;are to begin. The care and ingenuity with which the
  French guard against having any annoying moments in life are well
  exemplified in this device. The free reading-room as an adjunct of
  the dry-goods store is not wholly unknown in New York, but the free
  <i>buffet</i> has not yet, we believe, been transplanted there. A
  very much cheaper and a far less praiseworthy mercantile trap for
  catching custom in the same branch of trade also originates at Paris.
  One popular store has a superb clerk, whose <i>spécialité</i> is to
  place himself near the door, and to murmur whenever a new customer
  enters, &quot;Hum! la jolie femme!&quot; The storekeeper is said to
  have observed that the effect was immediate and lasting, the
  new-comer remaining a faithful and habitual customer; but this device
  is not to be ranked for breadth of enterprise with the one already
  mentioned.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>The project to turn the famous palace of Madrid into a museum like
  that of Versailles inspires Angel de Miranda to recall the strange
  vicissitudes of government which the vast, majestic edifice has
  witnessed&#8212;it and its predecessor on the same site&#8212;during
  seven centuries. Situated in the western quarter of the city, its
  principal face dominates a grand esplanade called the &quot;Field of
  the Moor,&quot; after the Moorish camp there established in the
  twelfth century. A fortress first, the original structure was turned
  by Peter the Cruel, a lover of fine architecture, into a royal
  castle, or <i>alcazar</i>, as it was then called, the word being
  borrowed from the Arabic. It became thenceforth an historic spot of
  Spain. It was the prison of Francis I. after Pavia. It was the
  dwelling of Philip II., who first made it the official royal
  residence; and there died his son, Don Carlos, whose tragic career
  has inspired so much dramatic literature, from Schiller&#39;s fierce
  handling of Philip II. to the widely different treatment of the
  subject by Don Gaspar Nuñez de l&#39;Arce in his drama played for the
  first time the past year. In the same palace, continues Miranda, died
  Elizabeth of Valois. There Philip IV. had farces played by ordinary
  comedians while the <span class="pagenum">[pg 126]</span> tragedy of
  his own downfall was enacting without. A fire reduced to ashes the
  haughty Alcazar at the moment when the Austrian dynasty disappeared
  from the realm, and on its ruins Philip V., first of the Spanish
  Bourbons, built the sumptuous palace that exists today. Stranger
  tenants even than its predecessor&#39;s it was fated to
  see&#8212;Riperda, Farinelli, Godoy, who began his political rise by
  his skill with the guitar; and Joseph Bonaparte, to whom his
  fraternal patron said, &quot;Brother, you will have better lodgings
  now than mine.&quot; There Ferdinand VII. passed his life in breaking
  his word, and there reigned Isabella II., first adored, then
  execrated. Marshal Serrano established there his modest headquarters
  as regent of a provisory kingdom, and there lived Amadeo, who had the
  spirit to quit a throne which he could not occupy with dignity. What
  a story of changed times and manners does it tell, when, in a
  detached wing of this royal edifice, we find installed Don Emilio
  Castelar, foreign minister of the Spanish republic!</p>
  <hr />

  <p>&quot;I must be cruel, only to be kind,&quot; says Hamlet. In a
  different sense the kindness of some people is pretty sure to be
  cruel, their very charity ferocious. There is a story of an old
  maiden lady whose affection was centred on an ugly little cur, which
  one morning bounded into her room with a biscuit in his chops.
  &quot;Here, Jane,&quot; cries the good lady, twisting the tidbit out
  of his mouth and giving it to her maid, &quot;throw away the
  bread&#8212;it may be poisoned; or stop, put it in your pocket, and
  give it to the first poor little beggar you find in the street!&quot;
  The story is hardly overdrawn, for if &quot;all mankind&#39;s concern
  is charity,&quot; as Pope says, yet at least some of mankind&#39;s
  methods of exhibiting generosity are questionable. An English paper
  recounts that a Croydon pork-butcher was lately arrested for selling
  diseased pork, and the man from whom he bought the pig, being
  summoned as a witness, admitted that the animal had been killed
  &quot;because it was not very well&quot;&#8212;that he was just about
  to bury the carcass when the butcher opportunely came and bought it;
  but the strange point is that, in a burst of munificence, &quot;the
  head had already been given to a poor woman who lived near.&quot;
  Evidently, the worthy pair thought this to be the sort of charity
  that covers a multitude of sins; and to a question whether their
  intents, as a whole, were wicked or charitable, they might properly
  have answered &quot;Both.&quot; The &quot;charities that soothe and
  heal and bless&quot; are not the only ones that pass current under
  the general form of almsgiving.</p><a name="literature" id=

  <h2>LITERATURE OF THE DAY.</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Literature and Dogma: An Essay toward a Better Apprehension of the
    Bible. By Matthew Arnold. Boston: James R. Osgood &amp; Co.
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is a tract issued in the author&#39;s apprehension that our
  popular view of Christianity is false, our conception of the Hebrew
  and Greek Bible altogether hidebound and deadening, our notion of the
  Deity a picture that is doomed to destruction in the face of science.
  As it is a sincere scheme of individual opinion (though not of
  original opinion, being largely made up of graftings from a certain
  recognizable class of modern scholars), it could only be finally
  disposed of by following it up root and branch in nearly all its
  details, at the cost of writing a much larger book. No opponent will
  be likely to give it so much importance. For our part, we are quite
  content to exhibit a little tableau of the main theory advanced, and
  let this tableau speak for itself.</p>

  <p>We should perhaps begin with Mr. Arnold&#39;s matter, but it is
  hard to represent him at all without doing some preliminary justice
  to his manner&#8212;his attitude toward the Christian <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 127]</span> public, his dogma of urbanity, and the
  value of his way of putting things as a likelihood of making
  converts. This is the more appropriate as he thinks the Founder of
  Christianity, and its chief promulgators, such as Peter and Paul,
  gained most of their successes through manner. &quot;Mildness and
  sweet reasonableness&quot; he believes to be the characteristic of
  Christ&#39;s teaching&#8212;a presentment of truths long afloat in
  the Jewish mind so winningly and persuasively that they became new
  and profound convictions in all minds; and he believes that when
  these characteristics were withdrawn or veiled the teaching was so
  far ineffectual; that when Christ, addressing the Pharisees,
  abandoned &quot;the mild, uncontentious, winning, inward mode of
  working,&quot; there was no chance at all of His gaining the persons
  at whom His sayings were launched; and that Saint Paul certainly had
  no chance of convincing those whom he calls &quot;dogs.&quot; Now, it
  is inevitable for us to ask ourselves what chance Mr. Arnold,
  undertaking the most delicate and critical crusade that can possibly
  be imagined against the dearest opinions of almost everybody, will
  have with <i>his</i> method. The hard hits which the Pharisees got,
  and which the early churches sometimes received from Paul, were
  direct, terrible blows, adapted to a primitive age: Mr. Arnold&#39;s
  hits, full of grace and sting, are adapted to our own age, and are
  rather worse. When he calls Pius IX. the amiable old pessimist in
  Saint Peter&#39;s chair, or when he calls Dr. Marsh, an Anglican
  divine who had hung in the railway stations some sets of biblical
  questions and answers which he does not approve, a &quot;venerable
  and amiable Coryphaeus of our evangelical party,&quot; he uses
  expressions that will lash the ordinary Catholic and Churchman of his
  audience harder than the fisherwoman was lashed in being called an
  isosceles and a parallelopipedon. Not much more &quot;sweetly
  reasonable&quot; will he seem to the ordinary Cantab. when he says
  that the Cambridge addiction to muscularity would have sent the
  college, but for the Hebrew religion, &quot;in procession,
  vice-chancellor, bedels, masters, scholars, and all, in spite of the
  professor of modern philosophy, to the temple of Aphrodite;&quot; nor
  anymore &quot;sweetly reasonable&quot; will he seem to the ordinary
  innocent, conventional Churchman in asserting that the God of
  righteousness is displeased and disserved by men uttering such
  doggerel hymns as &quot;Out of my stony griefs Bethel I&#39;ll
  raise,&quot; and &quot;My Jesus to know, and feel His blood
  flow;&quot; or in asserting that the modern preacher, who calls
  people infidels for false views of the Bible, should have the epithet
  returned upon him for his own false views; and that it would be just
  for us to say, &quot;The bishop of So-and-so, the dean of So-and-so,
  and other infidel laborers of the present day;&quot; or &quot;That
  rampant infidel, the archdeacon of So-and-so, in his recent letter on
  the Athanasian creed;&quot; or &quot;<i>The Rock</i>, the <i>Church
  Times</i>, and the rest of the infidel press;&quot; or &quot;The
  torrent of infidelity which pours every Sunday from our pulpits! Just
  it would be,&quot; pursues the author, &quot;and by no means
  inurbane; but hardly, perhaps, Christian.&quot; The question is not
  so much whether such allocutions are Christian&#8212;which they
  possibly may be in Mr. Arnold&#39;s clearer aether&#8212;as whether
  they are adapted to his purpose of winning. He manages here and
  there, indeed, in trying on his new conceptions of old truths, to be
  exquisitely offensive. It will seem like trifling, and it will keenly
  wound, for instance, the person of ordinary piety, to have his
  &quot;Holy Ghost,&quot; his promised &quot;Comforter,&quot; called
  &quot;the Paraclete that Jesus promised, the Muse of righteousness,
  the Muse of humanity,&quot; and to have this solemn Mystery lightly
  offset against the literary Muse, &quot;the same who no doubt visits
  the bishop of Gloucester when he sits in his palace meditating on
  Personality.&quot; But he becomes most elaborately and carefully
  outrageous when, combating this same idea of Personality in the Holy
  Trinity, he calls it &quot;the fairy-tale of the three Lord
  Shaftesburys,&quot; in allusion to a parable which he is at the pains
  of constructing about a first Lord Shaftesbury, who is a judge with a
  crowd of vile offenders, and a second Lord Shaftesbury, who takes
  their punishment, and a third Lord Shaftesbury, &quot;who keeps very
  much in the background and works in a very occult manner.&quot; This
  seems like the talk not of a man who wishes to convince, but who
  wishes to wound: it appears to be completely parallel with the method
  of those dissenters, whom Mr. Arnold is never tired of inveighing
  against, who use invective because Christ used it, and who hurl
  epithets at a state church or titles. As for the new light which Mr.
  Arnold has to shed on the Bible and religion, it is a recasting in
  his own way of the old interpretation. He deals <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 128]</span> with miracles as Renan deals with them,
  believing that credence in &quot;thaumaturgy&quot; will drop off from
  the human mind as credence in witchcraft has done&#8212;that Lazarus
  underwent resurrection, since, having found the Life, he had passed
  through the state of death. The Hebrew God he believes to have been a
  conception, not positive and pictorial as ours is apt to be
  (influenced, perhaps, though Mr. Arnold does not say so, by the
  efforts of Christian art), but a tendency to righteousness, a current
  of superior virtue, plain enough to the Oriental mind without mere
  personality; yet it may be objected to this that the Oriental mind
  made for a personal God, when Jesus came, as delightedly as our Aryan
  race could do. It is not, however, our purpose to expose much of Mr.
  Arnold&#39;s theory. It will be accepted by some as the last
  effectual mingling of literary grace and spiritual insight; but
  others, especially when they find him saying that conduct cannot be
  perfected except by culture, will think this work the sheep&#39;s
  head and shoulders covering the bust of a Voltaire.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Rhymes Atween Times. By Thomas MacKellar. Philadelphia: J.B.
    Lippincott &amp;Co.
  </blockquote>

  <p>When we find actually embalmed in a book the simple and touching
  song, &quot;Let me kiss him for his mother,&quot; our first
  inclination is to take all its merit for granted and hurry by,
  capping the matter as we pass with the inevitable quotation which
  also begins with a <i>let me</i>, and refers to making the songs of a
  people, with infinitive contempt for the adjustment of their laws.
  The people for whom Mr. MacKellar&#39;s ballad was made, being young
  women in ringlets who press the suburban piano, have, we may
  reasonably hope, small need of the law any how, and we may be pretty
  sure that the verses which have touched the great popular heart are
  made in a spirit which is better than any law, even the law of metre.
  On reading attentively the poem in question we find a touching theme
  handled with simplicity, and in a certain sense earning its popular
  place, though no poem could possibly be so good as the simple
  fact&#8212;an ancient woman in a hospital at New Orleans arresting
  the coffin-lid they were placing over a young fever-patient from the
  North with the natural impulse, &quot;Stop! let me kiss him for his
  mother!&quot; That little sunbeam of pure feeling, sent straight from
  the affections of the people, is the real poet in the affair, though
  Mr. MacKellar has succeeded in investing himself with its simplicity,
  supporting his subject with tenderness and directness. When a writer
  happens, with luck in his theme and luck in his mood, to strike such
  a keynote, he is astonished in a moment by a mighty and impressive
  diapason, a whole nation breaking into song at the bid of his
  whisper. Mr. MacKellar doubtless would think it strange, and a little
  hard to be told, that this trifle outweighs the whole bulk, body and
  sum of his collection. He is a writer of old acceptance and
  experience, who began to rhyme long ago in <i>Neal&#39;s Gazette</i>,
  with &quot;occasional verses&quot; about &quot;no poetry in a
  hat&quot;&#8212;a question which was bandied, in the fashion of the
  times, through half a dozen assertions and replies, assisted by
  voluntaries from the public. A stage-ride from New York to Singsing
  at that day was something of an adventure, affording a subject for
  six cantos, which Neal was doubtless very glad to get for his
  journal. Neal&#39;s death, and the parting with Henry Reed and Dr.
  Kane, with some other local changes, extracted short laments from the
  author, whose tone is nevertheless usually cheerful and canny; but
  his ballad is his best.</p>

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
